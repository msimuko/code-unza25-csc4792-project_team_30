        "##Business understanding: Reference Classification Project\n",
        "\n",
        "### Overview\n",
        "This project develops an automated system to classify academic references by publication type using machine learning techniques. The system can distinguish between journals, books, theses, conference papers, and other publication formats, helping researchers and librarians organize academic literature more efficiently.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Business Understanding\n",
        "\n",
        "### Problem Statement  \n",
        "Managing and organizing academic references is a time-consuming process for students, researchers, and librarians. Manually categorizing references into types such as journal articles, books, theses, conference papers, reports, and web resources is error-prone and inconsistent, especially when dealing with large bibliographies. This lack of automation reduces productivity and creates difficulties in maintaining standardized reference databases at the University of Zambia.  \n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## Business Objectives  \n",
        "The project seeks to automate the classification of academic references into their correct publication types.  \n",
        "\n",
        "**Practical Success means:**  \n",
        "- Students and researchers spend less time categorizing references manually.  \n",
        "- Librarians can easily maintain structured institutional repositories.  \n",
        "- The system provides fast, accurate, and consistent classification regardless of reference style (APA, IEEE, etc.).  \n",
        "- A user-friendly interface (Streamlit app) is available for anyone to input a reference and receive an instant classification.  \n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## Data Mining Goals  \n",
        "To achieve the above objectives, the project will:  \n",
        "- Build a **classification model** that automatically predicts the type of reference (Journal, Book, Thesis, Conference, Report, Web) based on its textual structure.  \n",
        "- Apply **TF-IDF feature extraction** on textual data to transform references into numerical representations suitable for machine learning.  \n",
        "- Train and evaluate machine learning models (e.g., Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or SVM) to determine the best-performing classifier.  \n",
        "- Deploy the trained model in a **Streamlit web application** for real-time use.  \n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## Initial Project Success Criteria  \n",
        "- **Technical Success:**  \n",
        "  - The model should achieve at least **80% classification accuracy** on test data.  \n",
        "  - Classification reports (precision, recall, F1-score) must show balanced performance across all categories.  \n",
        "- **Business/Practical Success:**  \n",
        "  - The tool should classify new references **within 2 seconds** per input.  \n",
        "  - The Streamlit interface must be simple enough for **non-technical users** to operate without training.  \n",
        "  - At least **five reference types** must be reliably classified.  \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Publication Types\n",
        "The model classifies references into the following categories:\n",
        "- **Journal Articles**: Peer-reviewed academic papers\n",
        "- **Books**: Monographs and edited volumes\n",
        "- **Thesis/Dissertations**: Graduate research works\n",

The underlying software was initially designed to enable access\\nfrom as many people as possible so usage requirements were minimal \\u2013 it was not even\\nnecessary to use a Web server or database. However, the system was not focused on\\npreservation, extensibility or reusability. In this article it is argued that such desirable\\nattributes could manifest themselves in a natural evolution of the Bleek and Lloyd software\\nsystem in the direction of greater simplicity. A case study demonstrates that this is indeed\\nfeasible in the case of the Digital Bleek and Lloyd and potentially more generally applicable\\nin digital libraries.\\nKeywords\\nDigital libraries, digital preservation, developing world, extensibility, reusability, simplicity\\n1\\n1 Introduction\\nStorage of information in digital form is increasingly becoming popular due to the flexibility\\nand cost-effective nature of storage media. This data proliferation of both born-digital and\\ndigitised information has effectively increased the amount of digital information that is at risk\\nof loss due to obsolescence of hardware and software, and physical damage. The process of\\nmanaging this content and its associated representations over time to guarantee their long-\\nterm usability is known as digital preservation. It collectively requires the establishment and\\nimplementation of a reliable preservation policy and well-coordinated procedures to ensure\\nthat the digital objects are preserved against hardware and/or software obsolescence, media\\nfailure and any other potential physical threats posed on the digital objects 14.\\nThe preservation of digital information requires constant attention due to the fast pace at\\nwhich technology is advancing and because of the delicate nature of digital storage media that\\nis used to store digital content. A typical digital preservation procedure involves activities\\nsuch as: regularly backing up of data to a different location to ensure its availability in the\\nevent of a disaster; refreshing of media by copying the digital information from one media to\\nanother; migration of digital content after a change in hardware and/or software technology\\nused; and development of disaster recovery plans. However, in most developing countries,\\ndata producers such as cultural heritage organisations pay insufficient attention to issues\\nsurrounding digital preservation. Their digital collections are often stored in digital library\\nand content management systems that are primarily set up for management of assets and\\nexternal visibility. Activities such as migration to other platforms are assigned a lower\\npriority. In this article, it is argued that a change in the fundamental architecture of the digital\\nlibrary system can potentially improve the preservability of a collection.\\n2\\nSimpler architectures for digital library systems may also make it easier to interconnect\\nsystems and extend or modify the features of a specific system. In developing countries,\\nextensions and modifications are relatively rare, given the lack of human and machine\\nresources. Reducing the resource requirements may result in more digital library systems with\\nimproved services. Thus, this article presents some elements of an alternative architecture for\\ndigital library systems that is arguably easier to manipulate and therefore supports more use\\ncases and long term preservation.\\nIn our earlier work 19, we highlighted some issues that hinder widespread preservation\\nprojects in Africa. A number of possible techniques and solutions currently adopted in African\\nprojects to preserve heritage were also presented. Overall, simplicity is proposed as a\\npotential key criterion for building lightweight systems that are easy to maintain and migrate,\\neffectively reducing overall maintenance costs. In order to further our investigation on\\nsimplicity, a recent project 17 involved building a prototype lightweight, distributable, generic\\nrepository management and access system. The design approach centred on simplicity is\\npotentially useful in areas with limited resources and/or expensive Internet bandwidth.\\nThis article focuses on a case study where the Digital Bleek and Lloyd collection was\\ntransformed into a simpler form to gain all the potential advantages listed above. The\\nfollowing sections present background work, details of the case study, analysis of the case\\nstudy and, finally, concluding remarks.\\n2 Related Work\\nThe 1996 Task Force Report 21 on Archiving of Digital Information initiated formal research\\nin digital preservation. It is particularly important because it identified the core challenges of\\ndigital preservation for organisations that manage digital collections. A number of initiatives\\n3\\nhave since emerged to support digital preservation. The Open Archival Information System\\n(OAIS) reference model 5 provides a formal and comprehensive overview of digital\\npreservation and was approved by the International Standards Organisation (ISO) as the ISO\\n14721 standard. It has since been used as a basis for most tools that currently facilitate\\npreservation. Preservation Metadata: Implementation Strategies (PREMIS) is a working\\ngroup, composed of international experts in metadata to support digital preservation activities\\n13. PREMIS is essentially a metadata community initiative that recommends best practices for\\npreservation metadata. The PREMIS working group published a data dictionary and an XML\\nschema to support the implementation of the data dictionary in digital archiving systems. The\\nNational Digital Information Infrastructure and Preservation Programme (NDIIPP) is a\\nprogramme, led by the Library of Congress, to archive and provide access to digital resources.\\nNDIIPP is a precursor to the National Digital Stewardship Alliance (NDSA), an organisation\\nfocused on improving preservation standards and practices 10.\\nIn the repository software development community, some projects have emerged as enablers\\nof distributed preservation. Lots Of Copies Keep Stuff Safe (LOCKSS) is an international\\ncommunity initiative that provides libraries with digital preservation tools and support to\\nfacilitate the preservation of authorised copies of digital content 12. DuraCloud is a managed\\ncloud service that provides organisations with the necessary cloud subscription services to\\nmake it possible to safely store digital content in the cloud by easily multiplexing digital\\ncontent storage with different providers 6. MetaArchive is a distributed alliance of university\\nlibraries, archives and research centres that works towards supporting distributed digital\\npreservation practices. The MetaArchive corporation uses a technical framework that is based\\non the LOCKSS software to ingest digital content into the geographically distributed network\\n15. However, these hosted services require payment of subscription fees periodically and work\\non the assumption that participating organisations have adequate Internet bandwidth.\\n4\\nStandalone repository software tools are commonly used to facilitate digital preservation.\\nGreenstone 1 and Omeka 8 are commonly used by cultural heritage organisations for creation\\nof digital collections. Greenstone is particularly popular in developing countries due to its\\nability to create digital collection archives that can potentially be distributed on a CD-ROM.\\nDSpace 20 and EPrints 7 are popular among academic institutions where they are commonly\\nused to build institutional repository systems. However, the downside of using such\\nstandalone tools is that the preservation and extensibility features built into them require\\nindividuals with full developer-level knowledge of the software packages.\\nIn contrast, the Library of Congress developed the BagIt specification that specifies a\\nhierarchical file packaging format for storage and transfer of digital content 2. The packaging\\nformat is specifically designed to facilitate the storage and transfer of digital content for long\\nterm preservation. The specification has resulted in the development of a number of utility\\ntools that are used to facilitate digital preservation 11. This concept of flexibility applies\\nequally well to services as it does to data. The Dienst 9, ODL 16 and OpenDLib 3 projects all\\nsought to decrease management and effort, without compromising on features, by introducing\\nflexible Web-based component architectures. In these cases, systems were created by\\ninterconnecting a suite of simple components to provide the necessary level of complexity of\\na fully-fledged digital library system.\\nThe projects described above demonstrate the feasibility of preservation-oriented data stores\\nand flexible service architectures, both premised on simplicity as an architectural principle.\\nThis article now merges, extends and generalises these ideas to create a minimal framework\\nfor simple digital library systems/collections, operationalised in the Digital Bleek and Lloyd\\ncollection\\n5\\n3 Case Study: The Digital Bleek and Lloyd Collection\\nThe Bleek and Lloyd collection is a 19th century compilation of notebooks and drawings\\ncomprising of linguistic and ethnographic work of Lucy Lloyd and Wilhelm Bleek on the life\\nof the |Xam and !Kun Bushmen people of Southern Africa. In 2003, the Lucy Lloyd Archive\\nand Research centre at the University of Cape Town embarked on a large scale digitisation\\nproject and all the artefacts were scanned and corresponding representation information\\ngenerated.\\nFigure 1. The Digital Bleek and Lloyd Collection\\nThe scanned images formed the basis for the implementation of a Digital Library System that\\nis used to store, manage and preserve digital objects, effectively making the digital collection\\naccessible online.\\nExplicit user requirements necessitated the implementation of an XML-centric solution that is\\naccessible on a wide range of storage devices (CD-ROM drives, USB drives and local\\nnetwork drives), is hardware independent and also requires minimal software installation. The\\ncollection is Web-based and accessible online 4, as shown in Figure 1. The implementation of\\nthe digital collection was based on pre-generated hyperlinked static XML pages from XML\\n6\\nsource data using XSLT. An Ajax-based search component was integrated with the static\\npages, coupled with a JavaScript routine to perform query operations 18.\\nThe collection's repository architecture was recently redesigned in an attempt to facilitate the\\nlong term preservation of the digital content and also to make it possible to easily integrate\\nthe system with new collections of recently digitised content and new services.\\n3.1 High Level System Architecture\\nThe high-level architecture of the system, as shown in Figure 2, is composed of three main\\nlayers: the client layer is made up of the user interface through which end users interact with\\nthe system; the service layer is composed of services that facilitate discovery of information;\\nand the repository layer is used as a storage facility for the digital objects. The repository\\nstores both the digital content and metadata objects on the filesystem, using a hierarchical\\nfilesystem structure, with the metadata objects stored in XML plain text files.\\n7\\nFigure 2. The Digital Bleek and Lloyd System Architecture\\n3.2 Collection Overview\\nTable 1 presents an overview of part of the Bleek and Lloyd collection; more content is still\\nbeing digitized and it is anticipated that these digital objects would eventually have to be\\nintegrated with the current digital collection.\\nTable 1. Overview of the Bleek and Lloyd Collection\\nCollection theme Historical artefacts; museum objects\\nMaterial types Digitised\\nCollection size 6.2 GB\\nContent type image/jpeg\\nTotal number of digital objects 18,924\\n8\\n3.3 Data Model\\nThe digital objects \\u2013 digital content and metadata objects \\u2013 are both contained in the\\nfilesystem, within hierarchical container structures \\u2013 filesystem directories. The hierarchical\\nstructures conform to the original collection structure that implicitly defines the relationship\\nbetween the actual digital content and collection types. Figure 3 shows part of the books\\ncollection structure of the Bleek and Lloyd collection. The hierarchical structure is important\\nas it helps to preserve the semantics of the digital content. It also helps in the overall\\nmanagement of the repository as bulk actions can be performed on objects contained within\\nthe same container. The other advantage of using a hierarchical model is that it helps to\\nimplicitly define relationships between disparate objects; in the case of the digital Bleek and\\nLloyd collection, it helps to define the relationship between actual digital content (e.g., the\\nimages) and virtual objects (e.g., the stories).\\n3.4 Digital Objects\\nThe metadata objects are stored as plain XML text files on the filesystem, alongside the\\ncorresponding objects that they describe. The XML text files are encoded using qualified\\nDublin Core 22.\\n9\\nFigure 3. The Repository Hierarchical Directory Structure\\nThis design strategy helps to simplify the preservation of the collection by making is easy for\\nthe collection to be migrated to other hardware and/or software platforms. The use of plain\\ntext files as storage for metadata, as opposed to the traditional mode of using a database, is\\nespecially useful as it makes it possible for the digital objects to be easily moved to any type\\nof hardware or software platform with very little effort. The use of the 'cCopy' utility\\ncommand present in virtually any operating sSystem is sufficient to move the entire\\ncollection. The explicit use of Dublin Core as the metadata scheme ensures conformance to\\ninternational standards and widespread understanding of the metadata. Physically storing\\nmetadata files with the actual objects makes it easier for the representation information to be\\nmoved together with the objects when moving to a different hardware and/or software\\nplatform.\\n10\\nFigure 4. A Sample Container Object XML Metadata File\\nFigure 5. A Sample Virtual Object XML Metadata File\\nFigure 6. A Sample Digital Content XML Metadata File\\n11\\nThere are three distinct types of metadata objects: container metadata objects define the\\ncomposition of a directory that can be composed of other container metadata objects and/or\\ndigital content; virtual objects help define the semantics of the images and collection as a\\nwhole by describing the logical association of the images and collection; and digital content\\nmetadata objects describe the actual images. The container-based metadata files are a\\nmanifest of the objects contained within them. Figures 4, 5 and 6 show sample metadata files\\nfor container objects, virtual objects and digital content objects respectively.\\n3.5 End User Access\\nThe collection front-end makes use of statically-generated HTML files, with an AJAX-\\nenabled search feature for online/off-line searchability of information. It is generated by\\napplying XSLT style sheets to all the collection metadata objects. This technological decision\\nremoves the dependency of a Web server and/or Application server for rendering of the\\ncollection content. The only software component that would inevitably be required is a Web\\nbrowser, effectively making it possible for the collection to be stored and accessed from other\\nhardware storage devices such as CD-ROMs, USB drives and local network drives.\\n4 Discussion\\nThe simple techniques and solutions used to redesign the digital Bleek and Lloyd collection\\nhave obvious advantages, particularly to organisations with limited resources. The solution\\nallows for the seamless moving of the collection to any hardware and/or software platform\\nand allows for the recreation of the collection in disaster recovery scenarios. The advantage of\\nthis is a cost-effective preservation strategy resulting from reduced reliance on expensive,\\ntechnically-inclined, human resources; and a simplified migration process that any computer\\nnovice would be capable of performing.\\n12\\nThe use of plain text for storage of metadata, as opposed to using a database, facilitates the\\nportability of system. The filesystem is a very efficient place to store data; in fact, that is\\nwhere many databases store their data files. Most importantly, however, the digital collection\\nuses the simplest possible retrieval mechanism (the reading of a file in a directory location)\\nand the data is seldom modified. The use of the filesystem for storage of the metadata makes\\nit the optimal storage location.\\nHardware and software obsolescence could easily be overcome as the collection can easily be\\nmigrated to a different platform. Additionally, plain text files are highly like to be supported\\nin future software versions. There is no guarantee that most of the currently existing\\nproprietary database formats will be supported in the near future or if future software versions\\nwill be backwards compatible, but text files in hierarchical directories are probably going to\\nbe understandable.\\nThe major challenge, however, would be to explore the scalability of such simple techniques\\nwhen applied to large and complex collections. Another challenge is perhaps brought about\\nby the use of static HTML files. The static collection necessitates complete regeneration of\\nthe entire digital collection when additional content is added to the collection. This is clearly\\nnot optimal as it would make it challenging to operate constantly changing collections.\\n5 Conclusions\\nSimplicity in the design of digital library systems is arguably a better bet for preservation of\\ncrucial cultural heritage collections. At the same time, simple architectures can support\\nextensibility and flexibility of services. These ideas were tested by converting the Digital\\nBleek and Lloyd to conform to these principles. The new system is wholly a replacement for\\nthe prior system, but with a digital object structure that enables simpler preservation over\\n13\\ntime and enables easier integration of new services. Thus, as a proof-of-concept, it has been\\nshown that it is possible to create a production-quality digital library system based on\\nfundamental notions of simplicity.\\nThis is, however, only a first step in providing sufficient evidence that a simpler architectural\\ndesign will work for digital library systems in general.\\n6 Future Work\\nThis simple approach to the architecture of digital library systems can be extended and\\ngeneralised further.\\nFor the most part, the solution presented is somewhat specific to the Bleek and Lloyd\\ncollection; there is thus a need to generalise this approach to make it applicable to a wide\\nrange of collections. This would require formally identifying design decisions that may\\ninevitably result in a simple, lightweight system that is easy to manage. This is particularly\\nimportant as it would highlight how simple repository storage and service architectures can be\\ndesigned.\\nA comprehensive evaluation of such an approach is also required to identify the advantages\\nand disadvantages that such solutions have when compared to well-established architectural\\npatterns. It would particularly be useful to establish the scalability of simpler architectures.\\nA number of existing solutions are implemented with out-of-the-box support for essential\\nfeatures like extensibility and interoperability. It would thus be imperative to explicitly\\nsupport such features. It may also be necessary to explicitly integrate the current solution with\\ntools and services that facilitate preservation, such as content conversion, logging and\\nintegrity checking.\\n14\\n7 References\\n1.

The underlying software was initially designed to enable access\\nfrom as many people as possible so usage requirements were minimal \\u2013 it was not even\\nnecessary to use a Web server or database. However, the system was not focused on\\npreservation, extensibility or reusability. In this article it is argued that such desirable\\nattributes could manifest themselves in a natural evolution of the Bleek and Lloyd software\\nsystem in the direction of greater simplicity. A case study demonstrates that this is indeed\\nfeasible in the case of the Digital Bleek and Lloyd and potentially more generally applicable\\nin digital libraries.\\nKeywords\\nDigital libraries, digital preservation, developing world, extensibility, reusability, simplicity\\n1\\n1 Introduction\\nStorage of information in digital form is increasingly becoming popular due to the flexibility\\nand cost-effective nature of storage media. This data proliferation of both born-digital and\\ndigitised information has effectively increased the amount of digital information that is at risk\\nof loss due to obsolescence of hardware and software, and physical damage. The process of\\nmanaging this content and its associated representations over time to guarantee their long-\\nterm usability is known as digital preservation. It collectively requires the establishment and\\nimplementation of a reliable preservation policy and well-coordinated procedures to ensure\\nthat the digital objects are preserved against hardware and/or software obsolescence, media\\nfailure and any other potential physical threats posed on the digital objects 14.\\nThe preservation of digital information requires constant attention due to the fast pace at\\nwhich technology is advancing and because of the delicate nature of digital storage media that\\nis used to store digital content. A typical digital preservation procedure involves activities\\nsuch as: regularly backing up of data to a different location to ensure its availability in the\\nevent of a disaster; refreshing of media by copying the digital information from one media to\\nanother; migration of digital content after a change in hardware and/or software technology\\nused; and development of disaster recovery plans. However, in most developing countries,\\ndata producers such as cultural heritage organisations pay insufficient attention to issues\\nsurrounding digital preservation. Their digital collections are often stored in digital library\\nand content management systems that are primarily set up for management of assets and\\nexternal visibility. Activities such as migration to other platforms are assigned a lower\\npriority. In this article, it is argued that a change in the fundamental architecture of the digital\\nlibrary system can potentially improve the preservability of a collection.\\n2\\nSimpler architectures for digital library systems may also make it easier to interconnect\\nsystems and extend or modify the features of a specific system. In developing countries,\\nextensions and modifications are relatively rare, given the lack of human and machine\\nresources. Reducing the resource requirements may result in more digital library systems with\\nimproved services. Thus, this article presents some elements of an alternative architecture for\\ndigital library systems that is arguably easier to manipulate and therefore supports more use\\ncases and long term preservation.\\nIn our earlier work 19, we highlighted some issues that hinder widespread preservation\\nprojects in Africa. A number of possible techniques and solutions currently adopted in African\\nprojects to preserve heritage were also presented. Overall, simplicity is proposed as a\\npotential key criterion for building lightweight systems that are easy to maintain and migrate,\\neffectively reducing overall maintenance costs. In order to further our investigation on\\nsimplicity, a recent project 17 involved building a prototype lightweight, distributable, generic\\nrepository management and access system. The design approach centred on simplicity is\\npotentially useful in areas with limited resources and/or expensive Internet bandwidth.\\nThis article focuses on a case study where the Digital Bleek and Lloyd collection was\\ntransformed into a simpler form to gain all the potential advantages listed above. The\\nfollowing sections present background work, details of the case study, analysis of the case\\nstudy and, finally, concluding remarks.\\n2 Related Work\\nThe 1996 Task Force Report 21 on Archiving of Digital Information initiated formal research\\nin digital preservation. It is particularly important because it identified the core challenges of\\ndigital preservation for organisations that manage digital collections. A number of initiatives\\n3\\nhave since emerged to support digital preservation. The Open Archival Information System\\n(OAIS) reference model 5 provides a formal and comprehensive overview of digital\\npreservation and was approved by the International Standards Organisation (ISO) as the ISO\\n14721 standard. It has since been used as a basis for most tools that currently facilitate\\npreservation. Preservation Metadata: Implementation Strategies (PREMIS) is a working\\ngroup, composed of international experts in metadata to support digital preservation activities\\n13. PREMIS is essentially a metadata community initiative that recommends best practices for\\npreservation metadata. The PREMIS working group published a data dictionary and an XML\\nschema to support the implementation of the data dictionary in digital archiving systems. The\\nNational Digital Information Infrastructure and Preservation Programme (NDIIPP) is a\\nprogramme, led by the Library of Congress, to archive and provide access to digital resources.\\nNDIIPP is a precursor to the National Digital Stewardship Alliance (NDSA), an organisation\\nfocused on improving preservation standards and practices 10.\\nIn the repository software development community, some projects have emerged as enablers\\nof distributed preservation. Lots Of Copies Keep Stuff Safe (LOCKSS) is an international\\ncommunity initiative that provides libraries with digital preservation tools and support to\\nfacilitate the preservation of authorised copies of digital content 12. DuraCloud is a managed\\ncloud service that provides organisations with the necessary cloud subscription services to\\nmake it possible to safely store digital content in the cloud by easily multiplexing digital\\ncontent storage with different providers 6. MetaArchive is a distributed alliance of university\\nlibraries, archives and research centres that works towards supporting distributed digital\\npreservation practices. The MetaArchive corporation uses a technical framework that is based\\non the LOCKSS software to ingest digital content into the geographically distributed network\\n15. However, these hosted services require payment of subscription fees periodically and work\\non the assumption that participating organisations have adequate Internet bandwidth.\\n4\\nStandalone repository software tools are commonly used to facilitate digital preservation.\\nGreenstone 1 and Omeka 8 are commonly used by cultural heritage organisations for creation\\nof digital collections. Greenstone is particularly popular in developing countries due to its\\nability to create digital collection archives that can potentially be distributed on a CD-ROM.\\nDSpace 20 and EPrints 7 are popular among academic institutions where they are commonly\\nused to build institutional repository systems. However, the downside of using such\\nstandalone tools is that the preservation and extensibility features built into them require\\nindividuals with full developer-level knowledge of the software packages.\\nIn contrast, the Library of Congress developed the BagIt specification that specifies a\\nhierarchical file packaging format for storage and transfer of digital content 2. The packaging\\nformat is specifically designed to facilitate the storage and transfer of digital content for long\\nterm preservation. The specification has resulted in the development of a number of utility\\ntools that are used to facilitate digital preservation 11. This concept of flexibility applies\\nequally well to services as it does to data. The Dienst 9, ODL 16 and OpenDLib 3 projects all\\nsought to decrease management and effort, without compromising on features, by introducing\\nflexible Web-based component architectures. In these cases, systems were created by\\ninterconnecting a suite of simple components to provide the necessary level of complexity of\\na fully-fledged digital library system.\\nThe projects described above demonstrate the feasibility of preservation-oriented data stores\\nand flexible service architectures, both premised on simplicity as an architectural principle.\\nThis article now merges, extends and generalises these ideas to create a minimal framework\\nfor simple digital library systems/collections, operationalised in the Digital Bleek and Lloyd\\ncollection\\n5\\n3 Case Study: The Digital Bleek and Lloyd Collection\\nThe Bleek and Lloyd collection is a 19th century compilation of notebooks and drawings\\ncomprising of linguistic and ethnographic work of Lucy Lloyd and Wilhelm Bleek on the life\\nof the |Xam and !Kun Bushmen people of Southern Africa. In 2003, the Lucy Lloyd Archive\\nand Research centre at the University of Cape Town embarked on a large scale digitisation\\nproject and all the artefacts were scanned and corresponding representation information\\ngenerated.\\nFigure 1. The Digital Bleek and Lloyd Collection\\nThe scanned images formed the basis for the implementation of a Digital Library System that\\nis used to store, manage and preserve digital objects, effectively making the digital collection\\naccessible online.\\nExplicit user requirements necessitated the implementation of an XML-centric solution that is\\naccessible on a wide range of storage devices (CD-ROM drives, USB drives and local\\nnetwork drives), is hardware independent and also requires minimal software installation. The\\ncollection is Web-based and accessible online 4, as shown in Figure 1. The implementation of\\nthe digital collection was based on pre-generated hyperlinked static XML pages from XML\\n6\\nsource data using XSLT. An Ajax-based search component was integrated with the static\\npages, coupled with a JavaScript routine to perform query operations 18.\\nThe collection's repository architecture was recently redesigned in an attempt to facilitate the\\nlong term preservation of the digital content and also to make it possible to easily integrate\\nthe system with new collections of recently digitised content and new services.\\n3.1 High Level System Architecture\\nThe high-level architecture of the system, as shown in Figure 2, is composed of three main\\nlayers: the client layer is made up of the user interface through which end users interact with\\nthe system; the service layer is composed of services that facilitate discovery of information;\\nand the repository layer is used as a storage facility for the digital objects. The repository\\nstores both the digital content and metadata objects on the filesystem, using a hierarchical\\nfilesystem structure, with the metadata objects stored in XML plain text files.\\n7\\nFigure 2. The Digital Bleek and Lloyd System Architecture\\n3.2 Collection Overview\\nTable 1 presents an overview of part of the Bleek and Lloyd collection; more content is still\\nbeing digitized and it is anticipated that these digital objects would eventually have to be\\nintegrated with the current digital collection.\\nTable 1. Overview of the Bleek and Lloyd Collection\\nCollection theme Historical artefacts; museum objects\\nMaterial types Digitised\\nCollection size 6.2 GB\\nContent type image/jpeg\\nTotal number of digital objects 18,924\\n8\\n3.3 Data Model\\nThe digital objects \\u2013 digital content and metadata objects \\u2013 are both contained in the\\nfilesystem, within hierarchical container structures \\u2013 filesystem directories. The hierarchical\\nstructures conform to the original collection structure that implicitly defines the relationship\\nbetween the actual digital content and collection types. Figure 3 shows part of the books\\ncollection structure of the Bleek and Lloyd collection. The hierarchical structure is important\\nas it helps to preserve the semantics of the digital content. It also helps in the overall\\nmanagement of the repository as bulk actions can be performed on objects contained within\\nthe same container. The other advantage of using a hierarchical model is that it helps to\\nimplicitly define relationships between disparate objects; in the case of the digital Bleek and\\nLloyd collection, it helps to define the relationship between actual digital content (e.g., the\\nimages) and virtual objects (e.g., the stories).\\n3.4 Digital Objects\\nThe metadata objects are stored as plain XML text files on the filesystem, alongside the\\ncorresponding objects that they describe. The XML text files are encoded using qualified\\nDublin Core 22.\\n9\\nFigure 3. The Repository Hierarchical Directory Structure\\nThis design strategy helps to simplify the preservation of the collection by making is easy for\\nthe collection to be migrated to other hardware and/or software platforms. The use of plain\\ntext files as storage for metadata, as opposed to the traditional mode of using a database, is\\nespecially useful as it makes it possible for the digital objects to be easily moved to any type\\nof hardware or software platform with very little effort. The use of the 'cCopy' utility\\ncommand present in virtually any operating sSystem is sufficient to move the entire\\ncollection. The explicit use of Dublin Core as the metadata scheme ensures conformance to\\ninternational standards and widespread understanding of the metadata. Physically storing\\nmetadata files with the actual objects makes it easier for the representation information to be\\nmoved together with the objects when moving to a different hardware and/or software\\nplatform.\\n10\\nFigure 4. A Sample Container Object XML Metadata File\\nFigure 5. A Sample Virtual Object XML Metadata File\\nFigure 6. A Sample Digital Content XML Metadata File\\n11\\nThere are three distinct types of metadata objects: container metadata objects define the\\ncomposition of a directory that can be composed of other container metadata objects and/or\\ndigital content; virtual objects help define the semantics of the images and collection as a\\nwhole by describing the logical association of the images and collection; and digital content\\nmetadata objects describe the actual images. The container-based metadata files are a\\nmanifest of the objects contained within them. Figures 4, 5 and 6 show sample metadata files\\nfor container objects, virtual objects and digital content objects respectively.\\n3.5 End User Access\\nThe collection front-end makes use of statically-generated HTML files, with an AJAX-\\nenabled search feature for online/off-line searchability of information. It is generated by\\napplying XSLT style sheets to all the collection metadata objects. This technological decision\\nremoves the dependency of a Web server and/or Application server for rendering of the\\ncollection content. The only software component that would inevitably be required is a Web\\nbrowser, effectively making it possible for the collection to be stored and accessed from other\\nhardware storage devices such as CD-ROMs, USB drives and local network drives.\\n4 Discussion\\nThe simple techniques and solutions used to redesign the digital Bleek and Lloyd collection\\nhave obvious advantages, particularly to organisations with limited resources. The solution\\nallows for the seamless moving of the collection to any hardware and/or software platform\\nand allows for the recreation of the collection in disaster recovery scenarios. The advantage of\\nthis is a cost-effective preservation strategy resulting from reduced reliance on expensive,\\ntechnically-inclined, human resources; and a simplified migration process that any computer\\nnovice would be capable of performing.\\n12\\nThe use of plain text for storage of metadata, as opposed to using a database, facilitates the\\nportability of system. The filesystem is a very efficient place to store data; in fact, that is\\nwhere many databases store their data files. Most importantly, however, the digital collection\\nuses the simplest possible retrieval mechanism (the reading of a file in a directory location)\\nand the data is seldom modified. The use of the filesystem for storage of the metadata makes\\nit the optimal storage location.\\nHardware and software obsolescence could easily be overcome as the collection can easily be\\nmigrated to a different platform. Additionally, plain text files are highly like to be supported\\nin future software versions. There is no guarantee that most of the currently existing\\nproprietary database formats will be supported in the near future or if future software versions\\nwill be backwards compatible, but text files in hierarchical directories are probably going to\\nbe understandable.\\nThe major challenge, however, would be to explore the scalability of such simple techniques\\nwhen applied to large and complex collections. Another challenge is perhaps brought about\\nby the use of static HTML files. The static collection necessitates complete regeneration of\\nthe entire digital collection when additional content is added to the collection. This is clearly\\nnot optimal as it would make it challenging to operate constantly changing collections.\\n5 Conclusions\\nSimplicity in the design of digital library systems is arguably a better bet for preservation of\\ncrucial cultural heritage collections. At the same time, simple architectures can support\\nextensibility and flexibility of services. These ideas were tested by converting the Digital\\nBleek and Lloyd to conform to these principles. The new system is wholly a replacement for\\nthe prior system, but with a digital object structure that enables simpler preservation over\\n13\\ntime and enables easier integration of new services. Thus, as a proof-of-concept, it has been\\nshown that it is possible to create a production-quality digital library system based on\\nfundamental notions of simplicity.\\nThis is, however, only a first step in providing sufficient evidence that a simpler architectural\\ndesign will work for digital library systems in general.\\n6 Future Work\\nThis simple approach to the architecture of digital library systems can be extended and\\ngeneralised further.\\nFor the most part, the solution presented is somewhat specific to the Bleek and Lloyd\\ncollection; there is thus a need to generalise this approach to make it applicable to a wide\\nrange of collections. This would require formally identifying design decisions that may\\ninevitably result in a simple, lightweight system that is easy to manage. This is particularly\\nimportant as it would highlight how simple repository storage and service architectures can be\\ndesigned.\\nA comprehensive evaluation of such an approach is also required to identify the advantages\\nand disadvantages that such solutions have when compared to well-established architectural\\npatterns. It would particularly be useful to establish the scalability of simpler architectures.\\nA number of existing solutions are implemented with out-of-the-box support for essential\\nfeatures like extensibility and interoperability. It would thus be imperative to explicitly\\nsupport such features. It may also be necessary to explicitly integrate the current solution with\\ntools and services that facilitate preservation, such as content conversion, logging and\\nintegrity checking.\\n14\\n7 References\\n1.

The underlying software was initially designed to enable access\\nfrom as many people as possible so usage requirements were minimal \\u2013 it was not even\\nnecessary to use a Web server or database. However, the system was not focused on\\npreservation, extensibility or reusability. In this article it is argued that such desirable\\nattributes could manifest themselves in a natural evolution of the Bleek and Lloyd software\\nsystem in the direction of greater simplicity. A case study demonstrates that this is indeed\\nfeasible in the case of the Digital Bleek and Lloyd and potentially more generally applicable\\nin digital libraries.\\nKeywords\\nDigital libraries, digital preservation, developing world, extensibility, reusability, simplicity\\n1\\n1 Introduction\\nStorage of information in digital form is increasingly becoming popular due to the flexibility\\nand cost-effective nature of storage media. This data proliferation of both born-digital and\\ndigitised information has effectively increased the amount of digital information that is at risk\\nof loss due to obsolescence of hardware and software, and physical damage. The process of\\nmanaging this content and its associated representations over time to guarantee their long-\\nterm usability is known as digital preservation. It collectively requires the establishment and\\nimplementation of a reliable preservation policy and well-coordinated procedures to ensure\\nthat the digital objects are preserved against hardware and/or software obsolescence, media\\nfailure and any other potential physical threats posed on the digital objects 14.\\nThe preservation of digital information requires constant attention due to the fast pace at\\nwhich technology is advancing and because of the delicate nature of digital storage media that\\nis used to store digital content. A typical digital preservation procedure involves activities\\nsuch as: regularly backing up of data to a different location to ensure its availability in the\\nevent of a disaster; refreshing of media by copying the digital information from one media to\\nanother; migration of digital content after a change in hardware and/or software technology\\nused; and development of disaster recovery plans. However, in most developing countries,\\ndata producers such as cultural heritage organisations pay insufficient attention to issues\\nsurrounding digital preservation. Their digital collections are often stored in digital library\\nand content management systems that are primarily set up for management of assets and\\nexternal visibility. Activities such as migration to other platforms are assigned a lower\\npriority. In this article, it is argued that a change in the fundamental architecture of the digital\\nlibrary system can potentially improve the preservability of a collection.\\n2\\nSimpler architectures for digital library systems may also make it easier to interconnect\\nsystems and extend or modify the features of a specific system. In developing countries,\\nextensions and modifications are relatively rare, given the lack of human and machine\\nresources. Reducing the resource requirements may result in more digital library systems with\\nimproved services. Thus, this article presents some elements of an alternative architecture for\\ndigital library systems that is arguably easier to manipulate and therefore supports more use\\ncases and long term preservation.\\nIn our earlier work 19, we highlighted some issues that hinder widespread preservation\\nprojects in Africa. A number of possible techniques and solutions currently adopted in African\\nprojects to preserve heritage were also presented. Overall, simplicity is proposed as a\\npotential key criterion for building lightweight systems that are easy to maintain and migrate,\\neffectively reducing overall maintenance costs. In order to further our investigation on\\nsimplicity, a recent project 17 involved building a prototype lightweight, distributable, generic\\nrepository management and access system. The design approach centred on simplicity is\\npotentially useful in areas with limited resources and/or expensive Internet bandwidth.\\nThis article focuses on a case study where the Digital Bleek and Lloyd collection was\\ntransformed into a simpler form to gain all the potential advantages listed above. The\\nfollowing sections present background work, details of the case study, analysis of the case\\nstudy and, finally, concluding remarks.\\n2 Related Work\\nThe 1996 Task Force Report 21 on Archiving of Digital Information initiated formal research\\nin digital preservation. It is particularly important because it identified the core challenges of\\ndigital preservation for organisations that manage digital collections. A number of initiatives\\n3\\nhave since emerged to support digital preservation. The Open Archival Information System\\n(OAIS) reference model 5 provides a formal and comprehensive overview of digital\\npreservation and was approved by the International Standards Organisation (ISO) as the ISO\\n14721 standard. It has since been used as a basis for most tools that currently facilitate\\npreservation. Preservation Metadata: Implementation Strategies (PREMIS) is a working\\ngroup, composed of international experts in metadata to support digital preservation activities\\n13. PREMIS is essentially a metadata community initiative that recommends best practices for\\npreservation metadata. The PREMIS working group published a data dictionary and an XML\\nschema to support the implementation of the data dictionary in digital archiving systems. The\\nNational Digital Information Infrastructure and Preservation Programme (NDIIPP) is a\\nprogramme, led by the Library of Congress, to archive and provide access to digital resources.\\nNDIIPP is a precursor to the National Digital Stewardship Alliance (NDSA), an organisation\\nfocused on improving preservation standards and practices 10.\\nIn the repository software development community, some projects have emerged as enablers\\nof distributed preservation. Lots Of Copies Keep Stuff Safe (LOCKSS) is an international\\ncommunity initiative that provides libraries with digital preservation tools and support to\\nfacilitate the preservation of authorised copies of digital content 12. DuraCloud is a managed\\ncloud service that provides organisations with the necessary cloud subscription services to\\nmake it possible to safely store digital content in the cloud by easily multiplexing digital\\ncontent storage with different providers 6. MetaArchive is a distributed alliance of university\\nlibraries, archives and research centres that works towards supporting distributed digital\\npreservation practices. The MetaArchive corporation uses a technical framework that is based\\non the LOCKSS software to ingest digital content into the geographically distributed network\\n15. However, these hosted services require payment of subscription fees periodically and work\\non the assumption that participating organisations have adequate Internet bandwidth.\\n4\\nStandalone repository software tools are commonly used to facilitate digital preservation.\\nGreenstone 1 and Omeka 8 are commonly used by cultural heritage organisations for creation\\nof digital collections. Greenstone is particularly popular in developing countries due to its\\nability to create digital collection archives that can potentially be distributed on a CD-ROM.\\nDSpace 20 and EPrints 7 are popular among academic institutions where they are commonly\\nused to build institutional repository systems. However, the downside of using such\\nstandalone tools is that the preservation and extensibility features built into them require\\nindividuals with full developer-level knowledge of the software packages.\\nIn contrast, the Library of Congress developed the BagIt specification that specifies a\\nhierarchical file packaging format for storage and transfer of digital content 2. The packaging\\nformat is specifically designed to facilitate the storage and transfer of digital content for long\\nterm preservation. The specification has resulted in the development of a number of utility\\ntools that are used to facilitate digital preservation 11. This concept of flexibility applies\\nequally well to services as it does to data. The Dienst 9, ODL 16 and OpenDLib 3 projects all\\nsought to decrease management and effort, without compromising on features, by introducing\\nflexible Web-based component architectures. In these cases, systems were created by\\ninterconnecting a suite of simple components to provide the necessary level of complexity of\\na fully-fledged digital library system.\\nThe projects described above demonstrate the feasibility of preservation-oriented data stores\\nand flexible service architectures, both premised on simplicity as an architectural principle.\\nThis article now merges, extends and generalises these ideas to create a minimal framework\\nfor simple digital library systems/collections, operationalised in the Digital Bleek and Lloyd\\ncollection\\n5\\n3 Case Study: The Digital Bleek and Lloyd Collection\\nThe Bleek and Lloyd collection is a 19th century compilation of notebooks and drawings\\ncomprising of linguistic and ethnographic work of Lucy Lloyd and Wilhelm Bleek on the life\\nof the |Xam and !Kun Bushmen people of Southern Africa. In 2003, the Lucy Lloyd Archive\\nand Research centre at the University of Cape Town embarked on a large scale digitisation\\nproject and all the artefacts were scanned and corresponding representation information\\ngenerated.\\nFigure 1. The Digital Bleek and Lloyd Collection\\nThe scanned images formed the basis for the implementation of a Digital Library System that\\nis used to store, manage and preserve digital objects, effectively making the digital collection\\naccessible online.\\nExplicit user requirements necessitated the implementation of an XML-centric solution that is\\naccessible on a wide range of storage devices (CD-ROM drives, USB drives and local\\nnetwork drives), is hardware independent and also requires minimal software installation. The\\ncollection is Web-based and accessible online 4, as shown in Figure 1. The implementation of\\nthe digital collection was based on pre-generated hyperlinked static XML pages from XML\\n6\\nsource data using XSLT. An Ajax-based search component was integrated with the static\\npages, coupled with a JavaScript routine to perform query operations 18.\\nThe collection's repository architecture was recently redesigned in an attempt to facilitate the\\nlong term preservation of the digital content and also to make it possible to easily integrate\\nthe system with new collections of recently digitised content and new services.\\n3.1 High Level System Architecture\\nThe high-level architecture of the system, as shown in Figure 2, is composed of three main\\nlayers: the client layer is made up of the user interface through which end users interact with\\nthe system; the service layer is composed of services that facilitate discovery of information;\\nand the repository layer is used as a storage facility for the digital objects. The repository\\nstores both the digital content and metadata objects on the filesystem, using a hierarchical\\nfilesystem structure, with the metadata objects stored in XML plain text files.\\n7\\nFigure 2. The Digital Bleek and Lloyd System Architecture\\n3.2 Collection Overview\\nTable 1 presents an overview of part of the Bleek and Lloyd collection; more content is still\\nbeing digitized and it is anticipated that these digital objects would eventually have to be\\nintegrated with the current digital collection.\\nTable 1. Overview of the Bleek and Lloyd Collection\\nCollection theme Historical artefacts; museum objects\\nMaterial types Digitised\\nCollection size 6.2 GB\\nContent type image/jpeg\\nTotal number of digital objects 18,924\\n8\\n3.3 Data Model\\nThe digital objects \\u2013 digital content and metadata objects \\u2013 are both contained in the\\nfilesystem, within hierarchical container structures \\u2013 filesystem directories. The hierarchical\\nstructures conform to the original collection structure that implicitly defines the relationship\\nbetween the actual digital content and collection types. Figure 3 shows part of the books\\ncollection structure of the Bleek and Lloyd collection. The hierarchical structure is important\\nas it helps to preserve the semantics of the digital content. It also helps in the overall\\nmanagement of the repository as bulk actions can be performed on objects contained within\\nthe same container. The other advantage of using a hierarchical model is that it helps to\\nimplicitly define relationships between disparate objects; in the case of the digital Bleek and\\nLloyd collection, it helps to define the relationship between actual digital content (e.g., the\\nimages) and virtual objects (e.g., the stories).\\n3.4 Digital Objects\\nThe metadata objects are stored as plain XML text files on the filesystem, alongside the\\ncorresponding objects that they describe. The XML text files are encoded using qualified\\nDublin Core 22.\\n9\\nFigure 3. The Repository Hierarchical Directory Structure\\nThis design strategy helps to simplify the preservation of the collection by making is easy for\\nthe collection to be migrated to other hardware and/or software platforms. The use of plain\\ntext files as storage for metadata, as opposed to the traditional mode of using a database, is\\nespecially useful as it makes it possible for the digital objects to be easily moved to any type\\nof hardware or software platform with very little effort. The use of the 'cCopy' utility\\ncommand present in virtually any operating sSystem is sufficient to move the entire\\ncollection. The explicit use of Dublin Core as the metadata scheme ensures conformance to\\ninternational standards and widespread understanding of the metadata. Physically storing\\nmetadata files with the actual objects makes it easier for the representation information to be\\nmoved together with the objects when moving to a different hardware and/or software\\nplatform.\\n10\\nFigure 4. A Sample Container Object XML Metadata File\\nFigure 5. A Sample Virtual Object XML Metadata File\\nFigure 6. A Sample Digital Content XML Metadata File\\n11\\nThere are three distinct types of metadata objects: container metadata objects define the\\ncomposition of a directory that can be composed of other container metadata objects and/or\\ndigital content; virtual objects help define the semantics of the images and collection as a\\nwhole by describing the logical association of the images and collection; and digital content\\nmetadata objects describe the actual images. The container-based metadata files are a\\nmanifest of the objects contained within them. Figures 4, 5 and 6 show sample metadata files\\nfor container objects, virtual objects and digital content objects respectively.\\n3.5 End User Access\\nThe collection front-end makes use of statically-generated HTML files, with an AJAX-\\nenabled search feature for online/off-line searchability of information. It is generated by\\napplying XSLT style sheets to all the collection metadata objects. This technological decision\\nremoves the dependency of a Web server and/or Application server for rendering of the\\ncollection content. The only software component that would inevitably be required is a Web\\nbrowser, effectively making it possible for the collection to be stored and accessed from other\\nhardware storage devices such as CD-ROMs, USB drives and local network drives.\\n4 Discussion\\nThe simple techniques and solutions used to redesign the digital Bleek and Lloyd collection\\nhave obvious advantages, particularly to organisations with limited resources. The solution\\nallows for the seamless moving of the collection to any hardware and/or software platform\\nand allows for the recreation of the collection in disaster recovery scenarios. The advantage of\\nthis is a cost-effective preservation strategy resulting from reduced reliance on expensive,\\ntechnically-inclined, human resources; and a simplified migration process that any computer\\nnovice would be capable of performing.\\n12\\nThe use of plain text for storage of metadata, as opposed to using a database, facilitates the\\nportability of system. The filesystem is a very efficient place to store data; in fact, that is\\nwhere many databases store their data files. Most importantly, however, the digital collection\\nuses the simplest possible retrieval mechanism (the reading of a file in a directory location)\\nand the data is seldom modified. The use of the filesystem for storage of the metadata makes\\nit the optimal storage location.\\nHardware and software obsolescence could easily be overcome as the collection can easily be\\nmigrated to a different platform. Additionally, plain text files are highly like to be supported\\nin future software versions. There is no guarantee that most of the currently existing\\nproprietary database formats will be supported in the near future or if future software versions\\nwill be backwards compatible, but text files in hierarchical directories are probably going to\\nbe understandable.\\nThe major challenge, however, would be to explore the scalability of such simple techniques\\nwhen applied to large and complex collections. Another challenge is perhaps brought about\\nby the use of static HTML files. The static collection necessitates complete regeneration of\\nthe entire digital collection when additional content is added to the collection. This is clearly\\nnot optimal as it would make it challenging to operate constantly changing collections.\\n5 Conclusions\\nSimplicity in the design of digital library systems is arguably a better bet for preservation of\\ncrucial cultural heritage collections. At the same time, simple architectures can support\\nextensibility and flexibility of services. These ideas were tested by converting the Digital\\nBleek and Lloyd to conform to these principles. The new system is wholly a replacement for\\nthe prior system, but with a digital object structure that enables simpler preservation over\\n13\\ntime and enables easier integration of new services. Thus, as a proof-of-concept, it has been\\nshown that it is possible to create a production-quality digital library system based on\\nfundamental notions of simplicity.\\nThis is, however, only a first step in providing sufficient evidence that a simpler architectural\\ndesign will work for digital library systems in general.\\n6 Future Work\\nThis simple approach to the architecture of digital library systems can be extended and\\ngeneralised further.\\nFor the most part, the solution presented is somewhat specific to the Bleek and Lloyd\\ncollection; there is thus a need to generalise this approach to make it applicable to a wide\\nrange of collections. This would require formally identifying design decisions that may\\ninevitably result in a simple, lightweight system that is easy to manage. This is particularly\\nimportant as it would highlight how simple repository storage and service architectures can be\\ndesigned.\\nA comprehensive evaluation of such an approach is also required to identify the advantages\\nand disadvantages that such solutions have when compared to well-established architectural\\npatterns. It would particularly be useful to establish the scalability of simpler architectures.\\nA number of existing solutions are implemented with out-of-the-box support for essential\\nfeatures like extensibility and interoperability. It would thus be imperative to explicitly\\nsupport such features. It may also be necessary to explicitly integrate the current solution with\\ntools and services that facilitate preservation, such as content conversion, logging and\\nintegrity checking.\\n14\\n7 References\\n1.
