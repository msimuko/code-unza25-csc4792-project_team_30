        "\n",
        "## Overview\n",
        "This project develops an automated system to classify academic references by publication type using machine learning techniques. The system can distinguish between journals, books, theses, conference papers, and other publication formats, helping researchers and librarians organize academic literature more efficiently.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Business Understanding\n",
        "\n",
        "## Problem Statement  \n",
        "Managing and organizing academic references is a time-consuming process for students, researchers, and librarians. Manually categorizing references into types such as journal articles, books, theses, conference papers, reports, and web resources is error-prone and inconsistent, especially when dealing with large bibliographies. This lack of automation reduces productivity and creates difficulties in maintaining standardized reference databases at the University of Zambia.  \n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## Business Objectives  \n",
        "The project seeks to automate the classification of academic references into their correct publication types.  \n",
        "\n",
        "**Practical Success means:**  \n",
        "- Students and researchers spend less time categorizing references manually.  \n",
        "- Librarians can easily maintain structured institutional repositories.  \n",
        "- The system provides fast, accurate, and consistent classification regardless of reference style (APA, IEEE, etc.).  \n",
        "- A user-friendly interface (Streamlit app) is available for anyone to input a reference and receive an instant classification.  \n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## Data Mining Goals  \n",
        "To achieve the above objectives, the project will:  \n",
        "- Build a **classification model** that automatically predicts the type of reference (Journal, Book, Thesis, Conference, Report, Web) based on its textual structure.  \n",
        "- Apply **TF-IDF feature extraction** on textual data to transform references into numerical representations suitable for machine learning.  \n",
        "- Train and evaluate machine learning models (e.g., Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or SVM) to determine the best-performing classifier.  \n",
        "- Deploy the trained model in a **Streamlit web application** for real-time use.  \n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## Initial Project Success Criteria  \n",
        "- **Technical Success:**  \n",
        "  - The model should achieve at least **80% classification accuracy** on test data.  \n",
        "  - Classification reports (precision, recall, F1-score) must show balanced performance across all categories.  \n",
        "- **Business/Practical Success:**  \n",
        "  - The tool should classify new references **within 2 seconds** per input.  \n",
        "  - The Streamlit interface must be simple enough for **non-technical users** to operate without training.  \n",
        "  - At least **five reference types** must be reliably classified.  \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Publication Types\n",
        "The model classifies references into the following categories:\n",
        "- **Journal Articles**: Peer-reviewed academic papers\n",
        "- **Books**: Monographs and edited volumes\n",
        "- **Thesis/Dissertations**: Graduate research works\n",

The objectives of the study were; to identify the challenges post bereaved\\nlearners were faced with after the death of their parent(s), to determine the effect of CBT\\nas an intervention in improving the academic performance of learners experiencing post\\nbereavement challenges and to evaluate the efficacy of CBT in improving the academic\\nperformance and the mental wellbeing of PBL. The study employed a mixed method\\napproach with an embedded research design. Simple random sampling was used to select\\na total number of 45 learners that constituted the sample size. Data was collected through\\nstructured interviews, questionnaires, document analysis, focus group discussion and\\nobservations, and was analysed using thematic analysis and descriptive statistics. The\\nstudy established that PBL faced several challenges that negatively affected their mental\\nwellbeing and academic performance after the death of their parent(s). These challenges\\ncomprised: walking long distances to and from school, lower self-esteem, stigmatized as\\n\\u201corphans\\u201d, lack of food, love, parental control and representation by guardians, substance\\nabuse and fear of being abandoned. Based on these findings, CBT was administered as\\nan intervention. The CBT intervention included strategies that were designed to help each\\nPBL identify and deal with negative thoughts which affected his/her mental wellbeing by\\nconsidering alternative perspectives. Behavioral strategies such as gradual exposure to\\nfeared situations, deep breathing, decision making, muscle relaxation exercises, reduction\\nof unhelpful behaviours that contributed to anxiety, cognitive restructuring setting,\\nmanaging goals to apply in everyday life to overcome dysfunctional thinking during and\\nafter the administration of CBT were also inculcated in the PBL. This involved\\nquestioning practicality, annalysing positive beliefs and testing reality. The PBL were\\nencouraged to replace negative thoughts with realistic and positive ones to seal the\\ntherapeutic approach. The CBT intervention also included the inculcation of coping\\nskills, which indicated favorable responses as the PBL gained enough skills to continue\\non their own. Based on the comparison of the pre-test and post-test results obtained before\\nand after the CBT intervention, the findings indicated an improvement in the behaviour\\nand academic performance of the PBL. The findings also indicated that PBL had changed\\ntheir dysfunctional thoughts and beliefs about the way they perceived life, and that they\\nhad inadequate basic human needs which highly affected their academic performance,\\nself-esteem, and rational thinking. Failure to administer CBT could have increased the\\nnegative effects of stressors on the PBL need satisfaction. This study therefore,\\nrecommended that school policies should promote the emotional wellbeing of learners\\nexperiencing post bereavement by raising awareness on how to respond to bereavement\\nrelated challenges through the provision of school-support, outreach and specialist help\\nwhen appropriate.\\nKey words: Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT), Post Bereaved Learners (PBL),\\nbereavement, thinking, behaviour\\niv\\nDEDICATION\\nTo my sons Mulenga and Mufaya Mulenga, you are my pride and joy.

It highlights the background of the main problem of the research, and its\\nproblem statement. The chapter also outlines the main objective of the research and provides a\\njustification for the study. It entirely gives a picture of the need to research into the efficacy of\\nCBT in improving the academic performance and the mental wellbeing of learners\\nexperiencing post-bereavement challenges.\\n1.2. Background\\nThe death of a parent is a major life transitioning event that can be stressful and may increase\\nthe risk for mental health problems in school going youths and children (Cerel, Fristad,\\nVerducci, Weller and Weller, 2006). Many school going youths and children fail to succeed\\nacademically due to the challenges faced after the death of parents (Murray, Davidson, Haward,\\nand Brand, 2006; Kranzler, Shaffer, Wasserman, and Davis, 1990). The death of a parent may\\nimpact negatively on the learner\\u2019s academic achievement as a parent plays a critical role in\\nmost learners\\u2019 academic development (Stone & Church, 1968). Parental death may lead to\\nfinancial difficulties, change in residence, change in school, less contact with friends and\\nneighbours, and increased socio-economic responsibilities for the orphaned children.This\\nsituation has a huge effect on them as it negates their future general wellbeing. Therefore, this\\nstudy sought to investigate the efficacy of administering CBT in improving the academic\\nperformance and the mental wellbeing of learners experiencing post-bereavement challenges.\\nParents play a very important role in moulding a child into a psychologically and sociologically\\nadjusted person and that children who get full attention, affection and emotional satisfaction\\nfrom their parents develop perfect and healthy personality. The psychosocial domain of this\\ndevelopment includes changes in personality, motivation, affects, self-concept and social\\nbehaviour. Psychosocial changes involve the interplay of psychological (personal) and social\\n1\\nfactors. The childhood loss of parents represents a profound psychological trauma that\\nthreatens the child's social and emotional development.\\nExisting evidence suggests that bereaved children constitute a vulnerable population at\\nincreased risk for social impairment and psychopathology (Siegel, 1996; Finkelstein, 1988;\\nBerlinsky & Biller, 1982). A child with only one-parent feels insecure, alone and show\\nimmaturity of behaviour because; parental loss brings about emotional sufferings like\\nseparation anxiety disorder and depression. Young people whose parents are both alive have\\nbetter ability to form friendly relationships and have better social adjustment and are less likely\\nto be depressed, compared to those whose parents are dead (Berk, 1994). Therefore, the effects\\nof parental death on children and young people\\u2019s development are long lasting as it brings\\nabout deficiency in certain parameters of psychosocial functioning if an intervention such as\\nCBT is not administered in time. Psychosocial functioning encompasses physiological and\\nsocial factors, which are assumed to play a vital role in ensuring a persons' effective adjustment\\nin society. It covers the home and family, health and physical development, social\\npsychological relations, and adjustment to school work among others.\\nFrom a social and psychological perspective parents are primary institutes of a child's learning\\nand have great impact on child\\u2019s psychosocial functioning. When a child loses a parent(s), the\\npsychosocial functioning becomes disturbed due to the conditions of getting less than\\nappropriate psychological and social interaction, contact and experience with the parent(s). It\\nis said that healthy minds stimulate appropriate social relations which lead towards effective\\npsychosocial functioning, hence the death of a parent, be it of a mother or father and in some\\ninstances both, has negative effects on the physical health as well as psychological functioning\\nof a child. In this case the mental wellbeing and academic performance of a bereaved child gets\\naffected. This is so, because parents provide physiological as well as psychosocial satisfaction.\\nPsychosocial health is not limited to the concept of basic needs satisfaction rather it includes\\nsome of the higher order needs which must be fulfilled for a healthy development. Love,\\naffection, and security also indirectly affect the health of a child. Research has shown that\\naffection and love become basic needs of children and youths (Muller, 1992) and orphaned\\nlearners are unable to satisfy these needs.\\nBraden and Miller (2007) asserts that parental involvement in a child\\u2019s education has been\\nrelated to multiple positive effects in young people\\u2019s school achievement. Children whose\\nparents were involved in their education earned higher grades, had better attendance, completed\\n2\\nmore homework, and were more motivated to learn. This proves that parental involvement in\\na child\\u2019s education is of critical importance in the education welfare of young people. For\\ninstance, Zambia has a program for parent-teacher collaboration in the educational welfare of\\nthe learners which is referred to as Parent-Teachers Association (PTA). The purpose of this\\nassociation is to have parent-teacher involvement in the educational welfare of the learners in\\norder to enhance their educational needs. Brannigan, Hansen, Walsh, and Falco (2005),\\npostulates that a strong family-school partnership improves both academic and behavioural\\noutcomes for children. Hence, there is need to address the challenges that PBL face after loss\\nof a parent(s) who once stood as a supportive pillar in their educational welfare.\\nKendler, Sheth, Gardner and Prescott (2002) contend that the disruption of the parent-child\\nbond during childhood has been widely considered as an important risk factor in future\\ndevelopment of children. For instance, the Learners\\u2019 mental wellbeing and academic\\nachievement could be just one area largely impacted by such risk factors. Researchers have\\nalso discussed the pathways leading from the receipt of poor parenting in childhood to worse\\nmental health in later life. These models assert that children who receive chaotic, harsh or\\nneglectful care from their care givers develop poor emotional regulation strategies, which in\\nturn leaves them more susceptible to emotional distress later in life (Repetti, Taylor and\\nSeeman, 2002). Research findings are consistent with these models, indicating that\\nretrospective ratings of low parental quality during childhood are related to higher levels of\\nnegative emotionality in adulthood, including anger, hostility, depression and anxiety\\n(Lehman, Taylor, Kiefe and Seenman, 2009; Turner and Muller, 2004).\\n1.3. Statement of the Problem\\nLearners in schools that have experienced bereavement due to the death of their parent(s) fail\\nto succeed academically (Archibald, Bell, Miller, and Tudennan, 1962, Berlinsky and Biller,\\n1982, Reber, 1985). These learners go through many post bereavement challenges that create\\ndifficulties in coping with academic work (Murray, Davidson, Haward, and Brand, 2006;\\nKranzler, Shaffer, Wasserman, and Davis, 1990). This situation has a huge effect on the\\nlearners as it negates their future general wellbeing. Efforts to address the academic difficulties\\nexperienced by learners with post-bereavement challenges have been made through the\\nprovision of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT). However, there is very little knowledge\\nabout the efficacy of CBT on the improvement of academic performance of learners\\n3\\nexperiencing post bereavement challenges in Zambian schools. Therefore, this study sought to\\nexamine the efficacy of CBT in improving the academic performance of learners experiencing\\npost-bereavement challenges at Luanshya School for Continuing Education.\\n1.4. Purpose of the study\\nThe purpose of this concurrent mixed methods study was to investigate the efficacy of\\nCognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) in improving the academic performance and the mental\\nwellbeing of learners experiencing post-bereavement challenges at Luanshya School for\\nContinuing Education (LSCE) in Copperbelt Province. In this study, the efficacy of\\nadministering CBT was explored and measured by making comparisons between the previous\\nresults of already conducted tests and those obtained after the administration of CBT. This was\\nattained through document analysis, observation of the PBL throughout the study, Focus Group\\nDiscussion, in-depth interviews and questionnaires.

Significance of Study\\nThis study is important as it may contribute to the literature on the post bereavement challenges\\nlearners are faced with after the death of a parent. The study may also assist teachers,\\ncounsellors, education psychologists and administrators to have a better understanding of the\\nfactors that affect learners after the death of a parent. It is also hoped that this study may\\ncontribute to the international scholarships on the effectiveness of CBT as an intervention on\\nlearners experiencing post bereavement challenges after the death of a parent(s).\\n1.8. Limitation of study\\nConsidering that this study was conducted from one school, Luanshya School for Continuing\\nEducation, the findings may not easily be generalised to the rest of the schools in the country.\\nZainal (2007) explains that results of one school may not be generalised because it only\\ninvestigated one school which could not give an overall representation of the wider body of\\nsimilar instances. This implies that the small size of sample and detail of findings in this study\\nis mostly unique to a specific phenomenon.\\n1.9. Delimitation of the study\\nThis study was conducted at Luanshya School for Continuing Education formerly (Adult\\nTraining Centre), Luanshya District, Copperbelt province. There are about thirteen (13)\\nSchools for Continuing Education in Zambia. This school was chosen because it is specifically\\nestablished for those who have difficulties in attending regular schools, those who are advanced\\nin age and those who attain lower marks at second choice selection. The school also\\naccommodates a big number of orphans and vulnerable learners as evidenced from the school\\nregisters and records. The school has a population of an estimated number of 800 learners of a\\nmixed age range. In addition, the school is a General Certificate Examination (GCE) centre\\nand has several departments and programmes for academic and skills training, making it rich\\nfor a two-tire education system.\\n5\\n1.10 Theoretical Framework\\nThis study was anchored on Becks\\u2019 CBT model which stresses that thoughts and cognitive\\nconstructions are at the root of emotions and behaviour patterns. The core premise of this\\ntherapy is that maladaptive cognitions contribute to the maintenance of emotional distress and\\nbehavioural problems. These maladaptive cognitions include general beliefs or schemas, about\\nthe world, the self, and the future, giving rise to specific and automatic thoughts in particular\\nsituations (Beck ,1970; Ellis, 1962). Maladaptive behaviour is counter-productive and\\ninterferes with everyday living. The CBT focuses on changing an individual's thoughts\\n(cognitive patterns) in order to change his or her behaviour and emotional state. The CBT\\nmodel provides a useful framework for guidance and counselling teachers, teaching staff and\\nother behavioural mentors, as it allows them to understand the bereaved school-going youths\\nand children\\u2019s experiences. It also offers strategies to increase these younger people\\u2019s sense of\\ncontrol because CBT is based on giving insights towards psycho education, collaborative\\npragmatism, active problem solving, assessing the nature and quality of supports, and\\nimprovement of the adaptation to the new lifestyle after a mood disorder. In this therapy, post\\nbereaved learners may find their thoughts contributing to affective symptoms and feelings and\\nhow they can transform them (Kootker, Fasott, Rasquin, Heugten and Geurts, 2012). The figure\\nbelow depicts the CBT Model diagrammatically.\\nFigure1. CBT Model (Beck,1970)\\nThe above CBT model presented in figure 1, indicates that reason and emotion depict a\\ncomprehensive method of treating human disturbances. This model stresses that people feel\\naccording to what they think, that is, thoughts and cognitive constructions are at the root of\\nemotions and behaviour patterns. Therefore, this model sits well in this study because\\nCognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) deals with one\\u2019s cognition (thoughts) and behaviour.\\n6\\n1.11. Summary\\nThis chapter presented the background of the study, statement of the problem, purpose of the\\nstudy, research objectives, research questions and significance of the study. It also covered\\nthe delimitation, limitations, theoretical framework and definitions of key terms. The next\\nchapter looks at Literature Review.\\n7\\nCHAPTER II\\nLITERATURE REVIEW\\n2.1 Overview\\nIn this chapter, the literature review that highlights the research works done by other scholars\\nis reviewed. The reviewed literature is focused on the efficacy of cognitive behavioural therapy\\n(CBT) on children and youths experiencing post bereavement challenge. The literature\\nreviewed also brought forth various pieces of literature work that is associated to the conditions\\nof post bereavement; its effects on mental wellbeing and academic performance on post-\\nbereaved learners. Text books were used; Electronic literature search databases were also used\\nand these included PsycINFO, MEDLINE and PubMed. Both theoretical and empirical\\nliteratures were reviewed. Theoretical literature provided explanatory framework relevant to\\nthe problem at hand while empirical literature provided information on research conducted so\\nfar that is relevant to this study.\\n2.2. The Impact of Parental Death on the Learners\\u2019 Academic Performance and\\nPsychosocial Wellbeing\\nParental presence, particularly the years lived with the father and mother, has positive\\nassociations with various issues such as children\\u2019s cognitive skills, education, income and\\nwealth (Lang and Zagorsky 2001). The parents contribute to their children\\u2019s development by\\ndoing the parenting as such (Guo and Harris 2000; Thomsen 2015). Children whose exposure\\nto parental role modeling is limited due to parental death may lack those skills and, as a\\nconsequence, may be less successful in school and may experience other issues (Steele, Sigle-\\nRushton and Kravdal, 2009). Parents contribute to children\\u2019s education by helping with school\\nwork and providing informed advice on educational choices (Bj\\u00f6rklund and Salvanes 2010),\\nboth of which can be assumed to decline after parental death.\\nParental death may also have harmful consequences because of prolonged stress. Numerous\\nstudies have shown that parental death causes multiple stressors in a child\\u2019s life because, in\\naddition to losing a primary caregiver, the child is also exposed to series of changes that may\\ninclude moving to new neighborhood, a new school and living with the remaining parent\\u2019s new\\npartner (e.g., Amato 2000; Fauth, Thompson and Penny 2009). Therefore, this study endeavors\\n8\\nto identify the challenges learners are faced with after the death of their parent(s), thereafter\\nadminister CBT as an intervention to the challenges with a view to enhance academic\\nperformance.\\nAccording to a British study, children who experienced early parental death showed difficulties\\nin trust, relationships, self-esteem and feelings of self-worth, loneliness, isolation and the\\nability to express feelings as an adult (Ellis, Dowrick and Lloyed-Williams 2013).\\nAdditionally, the remaining parent\\u2019s caregiving can be impaired due to the stress of the loss of\\na partner (Amato and Anthony 2014; Steele, Sigle-Rushton and Kravdal 2009). If the surviving\\nparent is able to offer warmth and discipline, better resilience is predicted for the children (Lin\\net al. 2004), which leads to better overall outcomes for them. The current study tried to improve\\nthe lost trust, relationships, self-esteem, and feelings of self-worth, loneliness, isolation and the\\nability of self-expression through the administration of CBT.\\nIn another study of ten African countries, bereaved children were found to less likely enroll in\\nschool; the negative effect of parental death increased with the child\\u2019s age (Case, Paxson and\\nAbleidinger 2004). In South Africa, the loss of a mother was found to have more adverse effects\\nthan the loss of a father (Case and Ardington 2006). Paternal death was related to only the\\nfamily\\u2019s economic well-being. In Ethiopia, maternal death was associated with a lower\\nlikelihood of school enrolment and a higher probability of illiteracy (Himaz 2009). Paternal\\ndeath was associated with only the child\\u2019s sense of optimism about the future. In a later\\nEthiopian study, it was found that maternal death had adverse effects if a child was still in the\\nmiddle of childhood but not during early adolescence, whereas paternal death had adverse\\neffects in early adolescence (Himaz, 2013). In Indonesia, parental death was found to increase\\nschool dropouts in all age groups and at all school levels (Gertler, Levine and Ames 2004). The\\nresults also suggested that parental death had more severe effects for younger children. Paternal\\ndeath was found to have a slightly greater effect for elementary schooling than maternal death.\\nThe overall effect was largest close to school transitions.\\nIn Western countries the prevalence of early parental death is rare and the population\\u2019s\\neducational level is no similar to those countries than non-western ones, especially in Africa.\\ndditionally, cultural differences in children\\u2019s position in and responsibilities to the family are\\nlikely to play a role. In addition, there are also institutional differences in Western countries\\nwith the US offering the minimum support from the state and Nordic countries offering more\\nextensive support. Finland is a strong egalitarian welfare state that is, with the regard to\\n9\\nintergenerational mobility, quite open in comparison to North America (e.g., Erikson and\\nGoldthorpe 1992; J\\u00e4ntti, 2006), thus it is an ideal context for exploring the negative effect of\\nparental death\\n2.3. Efficacy of CBT in Improving the Performance of Learners Experiencing\\nPost-Bereavement Challenges.\\nCBT is highly recommended as a critical component of treatment, particularly when\\nmedications are contraindicated or ineffective (Driessen, Van, Don, Peen, Kool, Westra and\\nHendriksen, 2013). But it\\u2019s not clearly reported when contraindication and effectiveness are\\nreported in most treatments. There seem to be an oversight to the fact that post bereavement\\nchallenges, if untreated has multiple potential negative effects on the mental wellbeing and\\nacademic performance of learners (Elizabeth, Sarah, Allison, and Kristin, 2011). After the\\ndeath of a parent most children and youths are left without any psychosocial counsel as a\\npreparatory measure for the loss.\\nCBT is used in different regions especially the developed countries to treat disorders that come\\nabout as a result of experiencing the death of a loved one, but its effects as well as effectiveness\\nhas not been clearly documented. If used, most therapists use brief cognitive behavioural\\ntherapy (BCBT) aside other psychotherapy options such as art therapy and motivational\\ninterviewing. The reason for such an option has not clearly been unveiled.\\nThere seem to be a general lack of research in the effects of CBT on learners experiencing post\\nbereavement challenges and why it is preferred on the improvement of the mental wellbeing\\nand academic performance (Beck, 2006). If research has been done on the efficacy of CBT on\\nthe improvement of the mental wellbeing and academic performance of learners experiencing\\npost-bereavement stressful challenges, then, limited evidence in publication does exist.\\nThere seems to be a gap of knowledge and resource base, and the needed services in matters\\nof post-bereavement challenges faced by learners (World Health Organisation, 2012).\\nAlthough post-bereavement challenges are amenable to treatment, evidence shows that there\\nare more cases undetected, untreated or undertreated in secondary school settings (Driessen,\\nVan, Don, Peen, Kool, Westra and Hendriksen, 2013). Untreated and undertreated post\\nbereavement challenges have multiple potential negative effects on the mental wellbeing and\\n10\\nacademic performance of PBLs (Elizabeth, Sarah, Allison, & Kristin, 2011). The effects may\\neither be psychotic in nature or even morbidity.\\n2.4. Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy Studies\\nIn a qualitative research study conducted in Zambia with the Applied Mental Health Research\\ngroup (AMHR) at Johns Hopkins University on mental health issues, grief was identified as a\\nmajor problem in the Zambian community (Murray, Dorsey and Lucid, 2006). This study was\\nconducted across five different partner sites with Orphans and Vulnerable Children (OVC),\\nincluding: Barefeet, Ngombe Home Based Care, Kaunda Square Ministry of Health Clinic,\\nCity of Hope, and St. Paul\\u2019s School. The purpose of this study was to investigate the\\neffectiveness of TF-CBT in reducing trauma-related symptoms and impairments in critical\\nfunctioning ability. The AMHR group reviewed the treatment literature to identify intervention\\noptions that could be adapted to the Zambian context to treat these problems. Based on this\\nreview and consultation with local health professionals and mental health experts, an evidence-\\nbased therapy called Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (TF-CBT) was selected\\n(Murray, Dorsey, Skavenski, Jere, Kasoma, Bolton, Bass and Cohen, 2013; Bolton et al., DIME\\nmanual, module 6). The AMHR also used the results of the qualitative study to adapt, test and\\nvalidate an assessment tool to identify youth with trauma histories and significant (i.e. severe)\\nmental health symptoms (Murray et al, 2011; Bolton et al, DIME manual module 2). Through\\na number of studies, AMHR learned that TF-CBT was feasible, acceptable and potentially\\nefficacious (Murray, Dorsey, Skavenski, Jere, Kasoma, Bolton, Bass Phans and Cohen, 2013).\\nSince this study was more inclined to addressing trauma on or and vulnerable children, this\\ncurrent study was CBT aligned, and was based on modification of dysfunctional thinking which\\narises from both biological and psychological influences as a result of the post bereavement\\nexperiences that learners go through. Modifying dysfunctional thinking, behaviour and beliefs\\nleads to improvement in symptoms of post-bereavement challenges, hence improvement of the\\nmental wellbeing and academic performance of PBLs. The other gap in knowledge was the\\nsmall sample size of this study which was taken from a secondary school, with many PBLs\\ncoming from different home backgrounds and not from the OVC and partner sites.\\nIn another study conducted by (Murray, Dorsey, Skavenski, Jere, Kasoma, Bolton, Bass and\\nCohen, 2013), It has been reported that, orphans and vulnerable children (OVC) are at high risk\\nfor experiencing trauma and related psychosocial problems, yet little is known about what\\n11\\ninterventions may be effective. The purpose of the study was; to evaluate the effectiveness of\\nlay counsellor- provided trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy (TF-CBT), with\\ntreatment as usual to address trauma and stress-related symptoms among OVC in Lusaka,\\nZambia. The TF-CBT adapted for Zambia was proved to decrease stress-related symptoms and\\nproduced a smaller improvement in functional impairment among OVC. Although this study\\nwas Trauma- Focused CBT among OVC, it highlighted the stress-related symptom which is in\\nline with what secondary school learners experiencing post-bereavement go through.\\nTherefore, this current study sought to investigate the efficacy of CBT in reducing post\\nbereavement challenges in learners who have experienced the death of a parent(s).\\nO\\u2019Donnell, Dorsey, Gong, Ostermann, Whetten, Cohen, Itemba, Manongi and Whetten (2014)\\nalso conducted a qualitative study in East Africa, Tanzania, which was designed to test the\\nfeasibility and child clinical outcomes for group-based trauma-focused cognitive behaviour\\ntherapy (TF-CBT) for orphaned children. Using a task-sharing approach, the intervention was\\ndelivered by lay counsellors with no prior mental health experience. Primary child outcome\\nassessed was symptoms of grief; secondary outcome included symptoms of depression and\\noverall behavioural adjustment. All assessments were conducted pre- treatment, post-\\ntreatment, and 3 and 12 months after the end of treatment. Results showed improved scores on\\nall outcomes post-treatment, sustained at 3 and 12 months. O\\u2019Donnell\\u2019s study is important to\\nthe current study in that it provides an insight in the characteristics of group-based initiatives\\nin cognitive based therapy. However, there is a gap in O\\u2019Donnell and her cohort\\u2019s study which\\nthe current study endeavours to address. Their study was trauma focused and counsellors had\\nno prior mental health experience while this study is CBT focused with a trained CBT therapist.\\nIn another study conducted by Boelen, Kip, Voorsluijs and van den Bout, (2004), a group of\\n30 students who were grieving the loss of a parent or a sibling was examined against a control\\ngroup of 30 non-bereaved individuals with the object of tracing the relationship between beliefs\\nand emotional responses, and whether a loss affects the cognitive process. They also examined\\nwhether there was a relationship between cognitive variables and symptoms of traumatic grief,\\nand whether there were differences between bereaved and non-bereaved in their basic\\nsuppositions and level of irrational thinking. In this study, the results indicated that the group\\nof bereaved students had fewer positive beliefs about the significance of their world, of their\\nself-worth, and a higher level of irrational thinking than did the group of non-bereaved students.\\nThe results also showed a connection between the overall usage of irrational thoughts and those\\n12\\nspecifically associated with bereavement and between symptoms of traumatic grief. They\\nfound no relationship between basic beliefs and traumatic grief, although the beliefs reflected\\na lower cut-off of frustration that explained the higher rate of variability in traumatic\\nbereavement.\\nThese findings support the proposition that there is a connection between the adaptation to loss,\\nand the ability, even partially, to change the beliefs and adapt them to the new situation. It\\nmeans that treatment interventions such as CBT should focus on identifying the patterns of\\nirrational thinking and the emotional, non-adaptive consequences and adopting patterns of\\nrational thinking, whose consequences are healthy negatives. Such a thought pattern\\nemphasizes the choice that we have to adapt more healthily to an unwanted situation (Dryden,\\n2009; Ellis, 1994b; Ellis and Dryden, 1997). Although there is a difference in the study sample\\nsize and the methodology used, the study has broadened the research base for the current study.\\nYouth (2014) analyses the cognitive behavioural interventions with bereaved anxious youth,\\nin which two cases were intensively reviewed to explore how clients expressed, and how\\ntherapists accommodated around bereavement themes in a course of an empirically-supported\\ncognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) for anxious youths. In one case where a youth met criteria\\nfor principal generalized anxiety disorder, bereavement-focused strategies were incorporated\\nsecondarily into a standard manual-based protocol for anxiety. For the second youth who was\\ntreated primarily for bereavement, general CBT principles and strategies were applied to target\\nbereavement related themes, but a specific manual treatment was not used. Intensive review of\\neach case revealed bereavement themes that contributed to bereavement-related distress, which\\nincluded: depressive dysfunctional thoughts about the self, life, and the world; specific anxious\\ndysfunctional thoughts about the grief reaction; fear of abandonment; depressive avoidant\\nbehaviours, such as withdrawal from relationships or activities; avoidance of loss reminders;\\nand problems integrating the loss. These bereavement themes were found to be prominent in\\nthe earlier part of treatment and were targeted using cognitive behavioural interventions,\\nincluding bereavement-related exposures, behavioural activation, and proactive problem\\nsolving.\\nWith regard to Youth\\u2019s findings, this current study supports the use of CBT approach to\\nconceptualizing and treating post bereavement challenges faced by learners who had\\nexperienced the death of a parent(s). The principles and framework of CBT appear to\\nappropriately target the dysfunctional thoughts, avoidance behaviours, and poor integration of\\n13\\nthe loss that work to complicate the grieving process in learners experiencing post\\nbereavement. Kavanagh (1990), recommends CBT to be one of the most effective treatments\\nof a wide range of disorders; hence it has been suggested as treatment for bereaved children\\nand young people going through post bereavement experiences in this study.\\nComparing these four distinct psychotherapy approaches; interpersonal therapy (IPT),\\ncognitive behavioural therapy and non-directive counselling showed similar efficacy among\\nthe four (Cuijpers, 2008), this gives mixed evidence on the effects of CBT on the improvement\\nof the mental wellbeing and academic performance of PBLs.\\nCBT is a therapeutic intervention based on the premise that one\\u2019s thoughts and feelings play a\\nfundamental role in behaviour. It usually incorporates behavioural activation and cognitive\\nrestructuring according to a protocol with homework assignments (Beck, 2006). It provides\\nsupportive and insight-facilitating techniques to address the emotional background of the\\ndepressive symptoms by discussing current relationships, internalized past relationships, and\\nintrapersonal patterns (Dekker, Van, Maat, and Jonghe, 2008). These different treatment\\nmodalities are severely limited in low resource countries like Zambia.\\nIt is important now to realize that the treatment of post-bereavement challenges is resolute\\nbased on the PBLs history, current symptoms and treatment preference (Dennis, 2004).\\nHowever, a number of psychological symptoms need psychological treatment for the effective\\nmanagement of the person experiencing post-bereavement challenges.\\nCBT treatment approach is a relationship therapy. Misri, Kostaras, Fox, and Kostaras, (2004)\\nspecified that psychotherapy is the systematic use of a human relationship for therapeutic\\npurposes of alleviating emotional distress by effecting enduring changes in a patient\\u2019s thinking,\\nfeelings and behaviour. The mutual engagement of the affected person and the psychotherapist,\\nboth cognitively and emotionally, is the foundation for effective psychotherapeutic work (Kay\\nand Tasman, 2006). Therefore, treatment of post bereavement distress-related challenges using\\npsychotherapy such as cognitive behavioural therapy is a psychologically-based program,\\nincorporating education and advice, to target individuals\\u2019 emotional adjustment to the impact\\nof disorders that come about as a result of bereavement, and to increase their sense of control\\nover their recovery (Elizabeth, 2011).\\n14\\n2.5. Common Symptoms of Post Bereavement Challenges Among PBL in schools\\nSymptoms of post bereavement have a varied range. According to the online publication (Think\\nCBT 2018), the most common psychological and emotional symptoms of post bereavement\\ninclude emotional detachment, numbness, shock, disbelief, and denial, often occurring\\nimmediately following the loss, emotional distress which is often focused on separation,\\nresulting in an all-consuming sense of personal yearning, constant searching and sometimes\\nintrusive images of death. This distress can lead to continuous crying, dreaming, delusions,\\nvisual and auditory hallucinations and detached or erratic behaviour. Some people often\\nexperience severe anger, deny or protest the loss and often undergo significant periods of\\nanxiety and depression. Grief bursts can also occur when people experience short and highly\\nintense spells of anxiety and distress. These episodes can often occur on an unexpected basis\\nor following a period of improved mood or recovery. Musau (2013) also lists tearfulness,\\ndespondency, feeling of hopelessness, inadequacy, poor classroom attention, mood swings, and\\nextreme anxiety, guilty or hopeless, irritability, fatigue, loss of interests, and sleep disturbances.\\nBeck (2006) also itemizes change in appetite, feeling angry or nervous, not enjoying life as\\nmuch as in the past, lack of interest in friends or family, crying uncontrollably, feeling of being\\na bad person, trouble of concentrating, low energy and thoughts of harming oneself. However,\\nthis does not clearly state the symptoms common in different age groups especially among\\nsecondary school learners. There is therefore need to identify other common symptoms among\\nchildren and youth experiencing post bereavement distress challenges, and evaluate the\\ncontribution of the specific symptoms to the mental wellbeing and academic performance of\\nschool going children and the youths. It is evident that post bereaved people often continue to\\nexperience feelings of sadness for many years, however their ability and resilience to cope with\\nthe loss gradually improves upon the administration of CBT as an intervention. People\\neventually learn to cope with their loss and sadness.\\nAt present, post-bereavement challenges have been proposed for the fifth edition of\\nthe Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V): Adjustment Disorder\\nRelated to Bereavement, to be located in the main body of the text as an official diagnostic\\nentity; and Bereavement-Related Disorder, including a Traumatic Death Specifier, to be\\nlocated in the Appendix as an invitation for further research (Kaplow et al., 2012). These\\ndiagnoses currently do not include developmentally informed criteria, despite the importance\\nof developmental processes in the way children and adolescents grieve. In this article, a\\n15\\nselective review of the empirical literature and expert clinical knowledge to recommend\\ndevelopmentally informed modifications and Specifiers of the proposed criteria for both\\nbereavement disorders and strategies to improve future research was drawn. This article is\\nderived from an invited report submitted to the DSM-V Posttraumatic Stress Disorder, Trauma,\\nand Dissociative Disorders Sub-Work Group, and suggested modifications have received\\npreliminary approval to be incorporated into the DSM-V at the time of this writing. Adoption\\nof these proposals will have far-reaching consequences, given that DSM-V criteria will\\ninfluence both critical treatment choices for bereaved children and youth in the next generation\\nof research studies on post bereavement related disorder.\\nAlthough refraining from unwarranted diagnosis is important in evaluating a person\\nexperiencing post bereavement challenges, the need for treatment must also be considered. Post\\nbereavement is a severe stressor that can trigger the onset of a physical or mental disorder.\\nTherapists and counsellors and clinicians need to recognize and treat those disorders when\\npresent and a cause of significant morbidity or mortality. Untreated illness potentially interferes\\nwith natural healing and this is one pathway to the development of complicated grief. For\\nexample, major depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and sleep disorders often occur and\\nneed treatment.\\n16\\nIn Zambia, the SAD research (2010) was number eight of a series of briefs providing new\\ninsights on the wellbeing of rural children in Sub-Saharan Africa, a previously much under\\nresearched population. Its findings were derived from a longitudinal (2008-2010) controlled\\nstudy in five communities of Kafue District, Zambia. This study was aimed at evaluating and\\ndeveloping a results-based intervention programme focused on the interface between\\npsychosocial wellbeing and livelihood of PBLs. Further, the study identified particular risk and\\nprotective factors for the psychosocial wellbeing of vulnerable children. With regards to grief,\\nthe study established that the cause of grief among school going children in Kafue District, was\\nloss of parents. Such a loss ultimately has a negative bearing on the performance of children at\\nschool. Nkhoma (2012) whose dissertation focused on the challenges following the death of\\nparents in some selected townships in Lusaka urban district in Zambia also agrees with this\\nfinding. This current study strongly agrees with the SAD study because it has highlighted\\nparental death as a protective factor for psychosocial wellbeing and its negative bearing on\\nchildren\\u2019s performance at school, although it did not specify the kind of intervention which\\nwas provided to the children after the loss of parents. Therefore, this study endeavour to\\ninvestigate the challenges that learners experience after the loss of their parent(s), thereafter\\nadminister CBT as an intervention to improve on their mental wellbeing and academic\\nperformance.\\n2.6. Challenges Faced by PBL\\nCoyne et al (2012), in United States of America also conducted a research titled \\u201cthe death of\\na parent may have a profound negative impact on student\\u2019s academic achievement,\\u201d It was\\nfound that a parent plays a large role in most children\\u2019s academic development. The purpose\\nof this research was to better determine the types of struggles a student faces following the loss\\nof a parent by death. Previous research was analysed to help determine what manifestations are\\nmore significant following parental death. Results indicated that: academic achievement is not\\nresearched enough to state whether it is specifically impacted by parental loss through death,\\nelementary and secondary age groups are the most academically impacted, a child\\u2019s\\ndevelopmental level contributes to their reaction to parental death, a student\\u2019s emotional well-\\nbeing is the most commonly researched manifestation, and University faculty are the most\\ncommon publishers of this topic from previous research. This study recommended that there\\nis need for further research regarding the impact of parental death on learners. This current\\nstudy strongly agrees with this recommendation but further suggests that there is need for post\\n17\\nbereaved learners to undergo CBT treatment and motivational talks to raise awareness about\\nthe challenges that comes with the death of a parent(s), and the universality of death to man.\\nBy so doing, necessary adjustments would be made to overcome the impact of post\\nbereavement challenges on learners.\\nAdil et al., (2008) also conducted a study in Pakistan, which examined the effect of parental\\ndeath of adolescents on their psychosocial functioning. It was hypothesized that adolescents\\nwho had lost a parent would experience significantly more severe psychosocial problems\\ncompared to those having their both parents alive. Data were collected from the various\\ncolleges of Sargodha. Findings indicated that adolescents who had lost a parent reported severe\\npsychosocial problems as compared to those having their both parents alive. Significant\\ndifferences in psychosocial functioning of adolescents were found on health and physical\\ndevelopment, home and family, and adjustment to college work whereas the differences on\\npsychosocial relations came out to be non-significant. These findings are consistent with the\\nprevious work of Meiss (1952). Findings of Meiss' research showed that parental loss could\\naffect the health of adolescents. Another research showed that adolescents who had lost mother\\n(by death) before they were 17, were twice as likely to suffer from depression and anxiety\\ndisorder as compared to those who had their mothers alive (Flanagan, 1995). Parents' death\\neither father or mother affects the whole range of functioning of adolescents, the health or\\nphysical disturbances, therefore, are no exceptions. Adil\\u2019s study is similar to the current study\\nbecause both studies looked at the psychosocial effects that comes about as a result of losing a\\nparent to death, although a knowledge gap still exists because his study did not apply an\\nintervention such as CBT to decrease the effects of psychosocial problems which adolescents\\nwere experiencing.\\nParental absence, therefore, results in the loss of primary shelter, which crop up a lot of\\nphysical, behavioural and psychological problems. Depression has been found to be the major\\nproblem with bereaved adolescents (Flanagan, 1995). Children who lose a parent or grow up\\nwith strained family relationships face a greater risk as adults for health problems such as heart\\ndiseases. This is in accordance with Luecken's (1998) study of young adults' reaction to\\nstressful situations which showed that those who had a parent died when they were a youngster\\nand those who reported poor relationships with family members had higher blood pressure and\\nabnormal hormone responses to stress.\\n18\\nResearchers have also explored the implications of post-bereavement challenges for young\\npeople's lives in both the short and longer term to see if it may place them at greater statistical\\nrisk of experiencing unwelcome 'outcomes'. The range of outcomes considered includes:\\neducational issues; age of leaving home; sexual activities and health behaviour; aggressive or\\ndelinquent behaviour; depression; and self-concept and self-esteem. While the initial post-\\nbereavement responses tend to decline over time, mental health and other problems can persist\\nor even increase. There can be fluctuations over time, and delayed grief reactions may be\\ntriggered when subsequent life changes occur (Christ, 2000), such as the remaining parent re-\\nmarrying or the bereaved person having their own child. Any negative events that follow the\\ndeath, and the child\\u2019s resources for coping with these, seem to be significant for the long term\\n(Haine et al. 2008). However, the difficulty of disentangling the impact of bereavement from\\nother factors increases with the passage of time since the death, so drawing conclusions about\\nlong-term impact is apprehensive with problems. For instance, studies conducted with African\\nyouth have found that those who are orphaned have higher rates of maladaptive grief,\\nposttraumatic stress (PTS), depression, suicidal thoughts, anxiety, behaviour problems, and a\\nnegative outlook on their lives relative to those not orphaned (Atwine, Cantor-Graae and\\nBajunirwe, 2005)\\nDowdney (2000) also reports that suitable longitudinal studies do not exist to indicate whether\\nyoung people\\u2019s emotional or behavioural disturbance following bereavement will persist.\\nHowever, Christ and Christ (2006) cite Worden\\u2019s (1996) findings from the Harvard\\nBereavement Study of \\u2018late effects\\u2019 of child bereavement with differences in the levels of\\nclinical difficulty between parentally bereaved school-aged children and their non-bereaved\\ncontrols becoming significant two years after the death. At this point, bereaved children\\u2019s self-\\nesteem and beliefs about their control over life were significantly lower than those of their\\npeers. This current study totally agrees with these findings because the death of parent(s)\\nappears to be like an embarrassment to the bereaved because in most cases death happens when\\nit is least expected. Therefore, there is need to raise awareness among learners about death and\\nits devastating effect and that at the appointed time, everyone will die.\\nAccording to the reviewed literature, there is relatively little evidence concerning the\\nrelationship between bereaved young people and educational outcomes, and what there is tends\\nto suffer from the limitation of retrospective parental recall of child functioning prior to the\\n19\\ndeath, and a reliance on indirect measures of educational attainment. Dowdney (2000) notes\\nthat this limitation, combined with learner\\u2019s differences in academic skills, competence, and\\nresponse to parental death, means that it is difficult to conclude more than that outcomes will\\nvary between learners.\\nA more recent review (Haine et al., 2008) concludes that the balance of evidence does suggest\\nthat parentally bereaved young people are at risk of lower academic success. For example, a\\nUK study which reported on the GCSE results of 73 pupils who had lost a parent and 24 who\\nhad lost a sibling (Abdelnoor and Hollins, 2004) found that bereaved participants\\nunderachieved significantly depending on age, gender and parents\\u2019 employment history. The\\nexam scores of young people bereaved before the age of five or at 12 years old were\\nsignificantly more affected than those bereaved at other ages. The researchers suggested that\\nthe effect of bereavement may be prolonged, and that intermittent support could be needed\\nthroughout secondary and perhaps tertiary education. School attendance seemed to be\\nunaffected, however.\\nOn the contrary, not all outcomes of parental bereavement are negative. Thirteen young people\\nwho had attended a child bereavement service in Brewer et al, (2011) ethnographic study\\nreported a range of ways in which they had derived some positive psychological changes or\\npost-traumatic growth through their experiences of parental bereavement and participation in\\nthe service. These include a positive outlook, gratitude, appreciation of life, desire to live life\\nto the full, and altruism. In their study, (Wolchik, Coxe, Tein, Sandler, & Ayers 2008) found\\nthat over six years after the death of a parent, intra- and interpersonal coping processes\\nexplained improvements in several areas of growth including developing new areas of interest,\\naccepting help from others, and coming to a realization of personal strengths. Such studies\\npoint to the great range of responses that young people may develop after the experience of the\\ndeath of a parent or sibling, with some finding ways to turn their experience towards positive\\noutcomes, while others may struggle in ways that persist across their life course.\\nThere is some suggestion from clinical experience and research interviews that some bereaved\\nyoung people try harder and do better at school as a form of tribute to their dead parent\\n(Dowdney, 2000). Others report more difficulty in concentration, and distress, particularly\\nwhen memories of their dead parent are evoked in school. In addition, teachers of bereaved\\nchildren rate them as being significantly less attentive than matched classroom controls,\\n20\\nalthough it is not clear whether this impacts in any systematic way on attainment or school\\nrelationships.\\nAlthough most youths who experience parental death return to pre-death levels of functioning\\nby a year after the death (Worden, 1996), a sizeable percentage experiences significant\\ndepressive symptom such as social withdrawal, and academic difficulties long after the death\\n(Cerel et al, 2006). This research focused on explaining variability in adaptation after parental\\ndeath and has consistently shown that negative life and positive caregiver-child relationships\\nafter the death are significantly associated with fewer adjustment problems.\\nFrom a motivational perspective, major life events such as parental death influence outcomes\\nin part through their effect on basic needs. Skinner & Furrel (1994) argued that such events\\nthreaten the needs of relatedness, competence, and autonomy. Similarly, Sandler (2001)\\nproposed that stressors embedded in life transitions can threaten satisfaction of the basic needs\\nof positive self-worth, social relatedness and control, and that protective resources can facilitate\\npositive adaptation by promoting need satisfaction or decreasing the negative effects of\\nstressors on need satisfaction. According to Sandler (2001), children construe themselves in\\nrelation to their social context around these needs through self-system belief sets, which are\\nviewed as reflecting the degree of fulfilment of basic needs. Fulfilment of these needs should\\npromote the process of redefining and reintegrating oneself into a life without the physical\\npresence of the person who died. As this reintegration occurs, painful feelings decrease and\\nthoughts about the deceased no longer are dominate (Shear & Shair, 2005). This shows how\\nbereavement may have significance in young people's lives over long periods of time, even\\nwhile individuals cope and carry on. This significance may be seen in various terms, including\\ntheir spiritual development, their perspective on which they are and what is important in their\\nlives, and how to understand their own identities and family histories. The case studies also\\nprovide insight into the lives of bereaved young people who are not in touch with services.\\nThey may struggle over many years in response to major bereavement challenges, in ways that\\nappear to be quite unnoticed by those around them.\\n2.7 Summary\\nExtensive literature related to the devastating effects of parental death on the mental wellbeing\\nand academic performance of learners, and the efficacy of CBT on improving the mental\\n21\\nwellbeing and academic performance of learners has been reviewed. However, there is still\\nknowledge gap on the factors affecting provision CBT on learners experiencing post\\nbereavement challenges in secondary schools in Zambia. In addition, literature does not show\\nthe extent to which CBT services are provided in secondary school. In the next chapter the\\nresearch methodology that guided the study is discussed.\\n22\\nCHAPTER III\\nMETHODOLOGY\\n3.1 Overview\\nThis chapter provides an account for the research methodology employed by the researcher to\\ninvestigate the efficacy of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) in improving the academic\\nperformance of learners and the mental wellbeing of learners experiencing post bereavement\\nchallenges at Luanshya School for Continuing Education. Furthermore, the type of research\\ndesign used, target population, sample size, sampling techniques, research instruments and data\\ncollection instruments have been described. In addition, data analysis techniques, study\\ncredibility and ethical considerations which were adhered to in the process of conducting the\\nstudy are also presented. A summary is also given at the end of the chapter.\\n3.2. Research Design\\nThe research design employed in this study was anchored on a paradigm, strategy of inquiry\\nand specific research methods (Creswell, 2009). The paradigm used is the pragmatic\\nperspective which enabled the researcher to collect both qualitative and quantitative data.\\nFurther, the study employed the embedded mixed methods research design. In using the\\nembedded design, qualitative methods of data collection dominated over quantitative methods.\\nThus, it depended more on the descriptive analysis hence the frequency of the charts and tables.\\nWhen using the qualitative methods, the researcher depended a lot on the views of participants,\\nwhich implied asking broader questions through interviews while on the other hand the\\nquantitative method was used to assist the researcher to ask specific, narrow questions which\\nallowed the researcher to collect quantifiable data from participants through the use of a\\nquestionnaire. The other reason for using an embedded concurrent research design in this study\\nwas due to the fact that it enabled the researcher to collect and analyse quantitative and\\nqualitative data in a single study. In particular, the collection of qualitative data during an\\nexperiment may be to understand the process the participants were going through, whereas the\\nquantitative data assesses the impact of the treatment on the outcomes (Creswell, 2015).\\n3.3. Study Area\\nThis study was conducted at Luanshya School for Continuing Education formerly (Adult\\nTraining Centre), Luanshya District, Copperbelt Province. There are about thirteen (13)\\n23\\nSchools for Continuing Education in Zambia. This school was chosen because it is specifically\\nestablished for those who have difficulties in attending regular schools, those who are advanced\\nin age and those who attain lower marks at second choice selection.\\n3.4. Study Population\\nThis comprised of 59 learners who had experienced bereavement due to the death of a parent(s)\\nat Luanshya School for Continuing Education in Luanshya district.\\n3.5. Sample size\\nIn this study the total sample size of PBL was 75. In order to arrive at the actual sample size, a\\ntable 8.1 in Cohen, Manion & Morrison (2011: 143) was used and 59 PBL were sampled with\\nthe confidence level of 90%. Due to many challenges that were faced by the PBL which include\\namong others; early marriages, financial constraints and absenteeism, 14 PBL failed to\\nparticipate in this study. Hence, the sample size of was reduced to 45 from which information\\nwas gathered. Out of forty-five (45) PBL who participated in the study, twenty-two (22) were\\nmale aged between sixteen (16) and twenty-one (21) years old and twenty-three (23) were\\nfemale aged between sixteen (16) and twenty-one (21) years old.\\nTable 3.1, presents the common demographic factors of PBL. These included the number of\\npost bereaved learners, geographic location, single/double orphan, gender, age, level of\\neducation, age when parent/parents died, previous school attended before the death of\\nparent/parents and nature of death of parent. This was compiled during the interviews\\nconducted with PBL.\\n24\\nTable 3.1.

Sampling Procedure\\nMixed methods research uses more than one kind of sampling procedure (probability and non-\\nprobability) and samples of different sizes, scope and types (cases: people; materials: written;\\nother elements in social situations: locations, times, events) within the same piece of research\\n(Teddlie and Tashakkori, 2009; Teddlie and Yu, 2007). In this study, both probability and non-\\nprobability sampling techniques were used when selecting participants.\\n3.7. Description of the Sample and Sampling Procedure\\n3.7.1. Schools\\nIn Luanshya district, there is only one school for continuing education offering both skills\\ntraining and academic education. Therefore, the school was purposively selected in this study.\\n25\\n3.7.2 Learners\\nRandom sampling according to Kombo and Tromp (2006) is a method in which every member\\nof the population has an equal chance of being included in the sample. In random sampling,\\nthe participants are randomly selected from a list of a total population. Based on the merits of\\nrandom sampling technique as stated by Kombo and Tromp (2006), in this study, learners were\\nselected using stratified sampling. Stratified sampling was appropriate in this study because\\nlearners were stratified according to their sexes, thus boys and girls. Cohen, Manion and\\nMorrison (2007) argued that stratified sampling involves dividing the population into\\nhomogenous groups, each group containing subjects with similar characteristics. In this study,\\nthe researcher requested for a class register for all PBLs in the school. After obtaining the class\\nregister, the researcher stratified the names of the learners according to their sexes. Stratified\\nsampling was best for this study as it gave a sample that allowed equal participation by both\\nsexes. Then, simple random sampling was used to select 29 males and 30 females from each\\nstratum. This gave a total sample of 59 learners that were sampled. However, out of the 59\\nlearners who were given questionnaires, only 45 learners managed to return completed\\nquestionnaires and these were picked for the study.\\n3.8. Research Instruments\\nResearch instruments are tools used to gather information and this included the following:\\nObservation checklist, questionnaire, interview guides, records analysis checklist and focus\\ngroup discussion checklist (Kombo and Tromp, 2006). In this study, all the above stated\\ninstruments were used to collect data. The manner in which each instrument was used is as\\nfollows:\\n3.8.1. Questionnaire\\nA questionnaire in this study was preferred to collect information from PBL regarding the\\nchallenges faced after the death of their parent(s). It was used as a self-assessment tool for PBL\\nto state their academic performance in class, relationship with friends (how the participant was\\ninteracting with friends in school), classroom behaviour (the mood and altitude of the\\nparticipant in class) and participation in class (speaking in class: answer and ask questions,\\nmake comments and join in class discussions). The questionnaire was administered before and\\nafter the administration of CBT. The questionnaire had both open and close-ended questions,\\n26\\nand was used because some of the data required could not be gathered through face to face\\ninterviews. On capturing data through the questionnaire, the excel application was used. This\\nmethod was efficient and friendly as the respondents did not labour much to supply the required\\ndata. This made it very easy for the next stage of data collection.\\n3.8.2. Interviews\\nThe purpose of interviews in this study was to explore the views, experiences, beliefs,\\nmotivations and challenges faced by PBL on specific matters regarding their post\\nbereavement. Through the use of interviews PBL were able to state the challenges they faced\\nafter the death of their parent(s). In addition, the interviews provided a deeper understanding\\nof the social phenomena, most appropriate where little was known about the study\\nphenomenon or where detailed insights were required from individual participants.\\nInterviews were also particularly appropriate for exploring sensitive topics, where\\nparticipants did not want to talk about certain issues in a group environment. These were\\noral interviews based on the use of interview guides. They were flexible because they consisted\\nof both open and closed-ended questions and allowed the interviewer to probe further on\\nparticular issues. The interviews also allowed for repetition of questions where respondents\\nwere not clear. The interviews were also used as an instrument for initial, continuous,\\nsummative and psychological assessments regarding the academic performance and mental\\nwellbeing of the PBL before and after the administration of CBT.\\n3.8.3. Focus Group Discussion\\nIn this study, four groups of PBL were constituted to discuss their bereavement experiences\\nand challenges faced after the death of their parent(s). The course of the discussion was planned\\nin advance and the moderator relied on an outline, or moderator\\u2019s guide, to ensure that all topics\\nof interest were covered. The items discussed during focus group discussion were participation\\nin classroom activities, relationship with friends, anger, moods, classroom behaviour and\\nabsenteeism. The participants influenced each other through their answers to the ideas and\\ncontributions during the discussions. The discussions were stimulated by running comments\\nfrom the moderator and subjects. The fundamental data produced by this technique were\\ntranscripts of the group discussions, the moderator's reflections and observations.\\n27\\nThe focus group discussions enabled the researcher to gain a larger amount of information in a\\nshort period of time. The participants were able to bring to the fore issues relating to their\\nbereavement experiences, discuss each other\\u2019s strengths and weakness regarding their post\\nbereavement challenges which included their academic performance, participation in\\nclassroom activities, relationship with friends, anger, moods, classroom behaviour and\\nabsenteeism. The participants also debated on many issues regarding post bereavement. This\\noffered the researcher an opportunity to study the ways in which individuals collectively made\\nsense out of a particular phenomenon and construct meaning around it. This instrument was\\nparticularly utilized because it was objective, economical on time and focused on the academic\\nperformance and mental wellbeing of the PBL. The Focus Group Discussion was not only used\\nas an instrument for data collection but also as an instrument for the initial, continuous and\\nsummative assessments regarding the academic performance and mental wellbeing of the PBL.\\n3.8.4. Observation\\nThis study used observation as an instrument for data collection, pre-assessment, continuous\\nand summative assessments regarding the academic performance and mental wellbeing of the\\nPBL based on the need to obtain data from the actual setting (Cohen, Manion and Morrison,\\n2011:21). In the same way, the researcher looked directly at what was taking place in a situation\\nrather than relying on second-hand accounts. The observations were carried out throughout the\\nstudy, that is during lessons, interviews, Focus Group Discussions before and after the\\nadministration of CBT. Of particular interest to this study was the classroom behaviour and\\nacademic performance in which the behavioural and performance checklist was used. An\\nobservation checklist provided the criteria for observation and allowed the observer to show\\nPBL progress over time. This method helped to eliminate subjectivity in data collection and\\ngave the researcher accurate information related to what was actually seen in time and place.\\nThe observation technique increased the chance for the researcher to obtain a valid and credible\\npicture of the phenomena being studied (Kothari, 2008).\\nThe items on the observation checklist included classroom behaviour, interactions between\\nstudents and the dynamics between the teacher and students. This enabled the provision of rich\\ninformation descriptions of behaviour about PBL conversations, interactions, organizational\\nprocesses, and other type of human experiences obtained through observation. During these\\nobservations, PBL moods, relationship with friends, participation in class, anger, memory,\\n28\\nconcentration during lessons, attention and school attendance were observed. These\\nobservations were both participant and non-participant.\\n3.8.5 Document Analysis\\nDocument analysis is a systematic procedure for reviewing or evaluating documents both\\nprinted and electronic (computer-based and Internet-transmitted) material. Like other\\nanalytical methods in qualitative research, document analysis requires that data be examined\\nand interpreted in order to elicit meaning, gain understanding, and develop empirical\\nknowledge (Corbin and Strauss, 2008; Rapley, 2007). Atkinson and Coffey (1997) refer to\\ndocuments as \\u2018social facts\\u2019, which are produced, shared, and used in socially organised ways.\\nDocuments that may be used for systematic evaluation as part of a study take a variety of forms.\\nIn this study attendance registers, learners\\u2019 continuous assessment reports and classroom\\nattendance registers were analysed and recorded. The analytic procedure entailed finding,\\nselecting, appraising (making sense of), and synthesizing data contained in documents.\\n3.9. Data Collection Procedure\\nPBL were availed with the information sheet for them to read about the study. Interested PBL\\nwere then asked to sign the consent/assent form. The same participants were used as control\\ngroup and intervention group, that is for pre-tests and post-tests results. Data was collected by\\nmeans of interviews, questionnaires, focus group discussions, record analysis and observation\\nschedules. The interviews were conducted with one participant at a time to maximise the\\ncollection of data from each participants and emerging themes were recorded.\\nCBT was used as the principle Psychotherapeutic intervention on the PBL as the norm\\ntreatment. The principle investigator and a teacher by profession, who was well trained in CBT\\nand psychosocial counseling, administered the CBT to the PBL. The CBT sessions were\\nadministered to the participants in the intervention group on a weekly basis, and ran up to a\\nmaximum of 12 sessions. The CBT sessions lasted 45-60 minutes and targeted modification of\\nnegative patterns of thinking and behaviour occurring in the context of post-bereavement\\nperiod.\\nThe completion of the therapy was based on observation and confirmed by post-test scores,\\nregardless of the number of sessions attended. The principal investigator, made the relevant\\nobservations throughout the study, and the PBL with severe or complicated conditions were\\nreferred and recommended for further intervention. To determine the effect of CBT,\\n29\\nparticipants were objectively observed throughout the study using observation schedules.\\nDuring the observation process, the researcher recorded each item physically observed on the\\nschedule as appropriate. The observational method of collecting data had the advantage of\\novercoming the limitations of the self-report methods of collecting data (Mugenda and\\nMugenda, 1999). PBL were tasked to complete a questionnaire which required them to indicate\\nthe extent to which they agreed or disagreed with a series of statements.\\n3.10. Validity and Trustworthiness\\nIt was extremely important to ensure that the credibility of research findings for this study was\\naddressed. The aspect of validity and trustworthiness were taken care of as explained in the\\nsections that follow:\\n3.10.1. Validity\\nCohen, Manion and Morrison (2011) defined validity as the extent to which an instrument\\nmeasures what it is supposed to measure and perform what it is supposed to perform.\\nEvaluating the quality of research is essential if findings are to be utilized in practice and\\nincorporated into finding solutions to societal problems in the related field. In this study,\\nprolonged engagement, persistent observation, researcher\\u2019s reflectivity, member checking,\\nthick description, and triangulation were used as strategies to guarantee validity. Prolonged\\nengagement refers to spending extended time with respondents in their native culture and\\neveryday world in order to gain a better understanding of behaviour, values, and social\\nrelationships in a social context. Triangulation involved the collection of data through focus\\ngroup discussions, observations and literature review. However, the purpose of triangulation\\nwas not necessarily to cross-validate data but rather to capture different dimensions of the same\\nphenomenon. Member checking procedure allowed asking and confirming with the\\nparticipants if the themes or categories that emerged made sense. The researcher also\\ncollaborated with other colleagues who had experience in interpretative data analysis.\\n3.10.2. Trustworthiness\\nCredibility, transferability, confirmability and dependability are criteria that are employed to\\naccept the trustworthiness of qualitative findings (Shenton, 2003). These criteria are extremely\\nimportant in a qualitative approach.\\n30\\n3.10.3. Credibility\\nCredibility deals with the idea of internal consistency (Gasson, 2004). In this study, credibility\\nwas addressed by prolonged engagement with participants as well as persistent observation in\\nthe field during the research. Further, member checking and triangulation was employed.\\n3.10.4. Transferability\\nThis refers to the extent to which the reader of the particular study is able to generalize the\\nfindings of that study to her or his own context and addresses the core issue of \\u201chow far a\\nresearcher may make claims for a general application of their theory (Gasson, 2004). In this\\ncase, it implies similar situations, populations and phenomena (shenton, 2003). This was\\nensured through the provision of sufficient information about the research instruments, the\\nresearch context, processes and participants. In addition, Morrow (2005) suggested that since\\nspecific information is maximized in relation to the context in which the data collection occurs,\\nit was prudent to use purposive sampling in this study so as to ensure transferability of the\\nresearch findings.\\n3.10.5. Confirmability\\nShenton (2003) defined confirmability as a degree of neutrality in the research findings. In\\nother words, this means that the findings were based on the participants\\u2019 responses. This also\\ninvolved making sure that the researchers\\u2019 bias did not skew the interpretations of what the\\nresearch participants said. In order to address confirmability in this study, member checking\\nwas applied by asking the interviewees to clarify some responses which could have seemed too\\nambiguous to the researcher.\\n3.11. Data Analysis\\nData analysis involves the cleaning and organizing data, describing the data and testing of the\\nmodels in the relationships and associations. In this study, both quantitative and qualitative\\nanalyses were used. To ensure accuracy in data entry, data was firstly checked, cleaned and\\norganized. Checking and cleaning of data was done by cross checking to identify and correct\\nthe errors. The improvement of the academic performance and the mental wellbeing of PBL\\nwere compared before, during CBT process and CBT treatment through observation, document\\n31\\nanalysis, interviews and focus group discussion. To assess the effect of CBT on the\\nimprovement of the academic performance and the mental wellbeing of PBL, result before and\\nafter CBT intervention were compared. Analyses were done on the two tests, to see if there\\nwas a statistically significant difference between them, following pre-intervention and post-\\nintervention. Thematic and descriptive approach were used to analyse qualitative data that\\nemanated from the structured interviews for all the participants.\\nQualitative data was analysed using thematic analysis (Cohen, Manion and Morison, 2011).\\nThe researcher opted to use thematic analysis to identify concepts that could help make sense\\nof what was going on regarding the challenges faced by post bereaved learners. In this study,\\nconstructs, themes, and patterns were identified from the interviews as the researcher read-\\nthrough the data over and over to get a description of phenomenon under study (Gall et al.,\\n1996). The understandings of the phenomenon (post bereavement challenges) were noted.\\nInterviews were tape-recorded and transcribed before the analysis. The objective of the analysis\\nof the interviews was to understand and explain the impact of post bereavement challenges\\nlearners were faced with after the death of their parent(s) from the narratives. Transcriptions\\nand written texts of interviews were independently read and analysed. Qualitative descriptive\\nanalysis involved:\\ni. Developing codes that represented a category or theme found in the data and these were\\nput directly into the text by attaching to segments of text.\\nii. Each participant interviewed was evaluated by the set of thematic codes developed.\\niii. Recording insights and reflections on the data across the codes.\\niv. Sorting through the data to identify similar phrases, patterns, themes, subthemes\\nsequences and important features.\\nv. Looking for commonalities and differences among the data and extracting them for\\nfurther consideration and analysis.\\nvi. Gradually deciding on a small group or generalizations that hold true for the data.\\nvii. Examining these generalizations in the light of existing knowledge.\\nQuantitative data was analysed using descriptive statistics. The PBL questionnaire was\\ndesigned with open and closed ended questions. Firstly, the variables were created; and an\\ninitial data analysis was conducted to check the distributional characteristics. Frequency\\nanalysis was used to understand the trends of PBL performance, classroom behaviour,\\n32\\nrelationship with friends and participation in classroom activities before and after the\\nadministration of CBT. Descriptive statistics was used for the purpose of generating\\nfrequencies and tables regarding PBL performance before and after the administration of CBT\\nto assess its effectiveness.\\nSince the study involved both qualitative and quantitative research paradigms, the data gathered\\nfrom the interviews and observation schedules were categorized and arranged according to key\\nconcepts which corresponded with research questions. Thus, raw data was transformed into\\nmeaningful statements, graphs and tables for illustration purposes.\\n3.12. Ethical Considerations\\nThe research procedures were determined by the plan and the direction of the research in\\nadvance. Since the collection of information was largely dependent on research instruments\\nand the voluntary participation of the sampled respondents, it was of significance to seek\\npermission from all relevant authorities which included; the UNZA Ethical Committee were\\nthe clearance letter was obtained (Reference Number: HSSREC: 2018 AUG-024). Further,\\nthe researcher got permission from the Ministry of General Education through the District\\nEducation Board Secretary (DEBS), school authorities and guardians before commencement\\nof the study.\\nVoluntary participation was sought from the participants through a written informed consent\\nand assent. Participants were assured of their right to freely withdrew from participation at any\\ntime and without necessarily giving the reason.\\nRespect and justice were upheld through giving the participants empathy and freedom of choice\\non the language to use and how far the responses would be given. Anonymity and\\nconfidentiality were upheld. This was done by use of codes instead of names of participants\\nand securing data through locking it up. After the period of data collection, participants who\\ndid not fully recover after the period of study were referred to continued or follow-up treatment.\\n3.13 Summary\\nThis chapter looked at the methodology that encompassed research design, study site, target\\npopulation, sample size, sampling techniques, instruments for data collection, data analysis,\\n33\\nvalidity, reliability, trustworthiness and research procedures. The chapter also included ethical\\nconsiderations. In the next chapter, the research findings are presented.\\n34\\nCHAPTER IV\\nPRESENTATION OF THE FINDINGS\\n4.1 Overview\\nIn this chapter the findings of the study are presented. The findings are based on the following\\nthree (3) main objectives: to identify the challenges PBLs are faced with after the death of their\\nparent(s); to administer CBT as an intervention in improving the academic performance of\\nlearners experiencing post bereavement challenges and to investigate the efficacy of CBT in\\nimproving the performance of learners experiencing post-bereavement challenges. Data was\\ncollected through the use of the questionnaire, interview guides, focus group discussion,\\ndocument analysis and observations.\\n4.2. Challenges Faced by PBL\\nPBL responded differently to their challenges and the following are some of the notable\\nchallenges they were faced with after the death of their parent(s). Table 4.1 depicts the\\ndistribution of challenges leaners where faced with after the death of their parent(s).\\nTable 4.1.\\nItems responses F\\nAbsenteeism from school as a result of stressful factors 3\\nStress as a result of walking long distances to school 4\\nstress as a result of material and financial lack 4\\nLower self-esteem as a result of improper uniforms 5\\nworry as a result of daily life struggles and lack of food 4\\nLack of love from care givers who are already burdened 6\\nMemorable reminders of the deceased parent (s) 3\\nDepression as a result of parental death 4\\nDepression as a result of lack of representation by care 5\\nnegative emotions such as sadness, frustration, and pain 4\\nFear of being rejected by the guardian. 3\\n35\\nFrom the illustrations in Table 4.1, it is noticeable that PBL had similar responses regarding\\ntheir challenges experienced after the death of their parent(s). In particular, 3 out of 45 PBL\\nhad expressed ideas which included; lower self-esteem as a result of not having biological\\nparents and being labelled as an \\u201corphan\\u201d both in school and at home, Fear of being rejected\\nby the guardian, memorable reminders of the deceased parent(s). In addition, 4 out of 45 PBL\\nexpressed the following similar opinions; negative emotions such as sadness, frustration, and\\npain, depression as a result of parental death, lack of love from care givers who are already\\nburdened and stress as a result of walking long distances to school.\\nIn order to get more understanding of the challenges faced by the PBLs, this is what one PBL\\nsaid:\\nI stay in Fisenge farm block area which is 8km away from my school. I walk a distance of eight\\nkilometres every day to and from school because I do not have a bicycle to use when going to\\nschool. Due to the long distances from home to school, I normally arrive late such that every\\nday I miss the first period. This has made me to be behind, because my friends manage to reach\\nschool on time because they use bicycles, and some are taken to school in cars by their parents.\\nThe fact that I stay very far from school, I normally fail to complete the five school days coming\\nto school because I get tired. When it comes to class work, I do very well in my studies. I wish\\nmy parents were not dead. Sometimes I feel like taking my own life because these sufferings\\nare never ending (Interviewed, October 2017).\\nBesides, another PBL when interviewed expressed the following sentiments:\\nAs you look at me madam, I am a parent on my own. I have no one to help me with my\\neducation. My parents died when I was a little boy and since that time I live with my\\ngrandmother. I just keep imagining how they used to look like. Sometimes I wander a lot when\\nI think about my parents. May be I should just follow them. Life is very difficult for me because\\nI have no one to help me in challenging situations. Sometimes I go for days without eating\\nnshima and this lowers my morale to be in class. If I have a challenging piece work, sometimes\\nI abandon going to school.\\nThese were the views of PBL regarding the challenges they were faced with after the death of\\ntheir parent(s). The information is a blend of the experiences of the PBL from Luanshya School\\nfor Continuing Education. These sub-themes emerged as a result of the interview with each\\nindividual PBL.\\n4.3. Pre-Test Before the Administration of CBT in Improving the Academic\\nPerformance of PBL Experiencing Bereavement Challenges\\nPBL were subjected to a questionnaire, interviews, document analysis and objective\\nobservation in their respective classes for three weeks before the administration of CBT. The\\nPBL were also observed in classroom behaviour and academic performance. The following\\n36\\nitems were noted during observations and document analysis where continuous assessments\\nfrom the previous tests were recorded, relationship with friend, hopefulness for a better life,\\nperformance in class, self -confidence, concentration on school work, school attendance,\\nattention when talking to someone, anger, mood and memory. This was done in order to obtain\\ncorrect information before the administration of CBT.\\n4.2.1. Performance in Class at Pre-Test Before the Administration of CBT\\nIn order to solicit for this information, question 2 in a questionnaire (refer to question 2\\nappendix B) which required the PBL to indicate their opinion on a five point Likert Scale, and\\nthe classroom behaviour and academic checklist were used. On a Likert Scale, 1= represented\\nexcellent, 2=Very Good, 3=Good, 4=Average and 5=Poor. The following were the results\\ncollected from the questionnaire on the performance of PBL in class at pre-test before the\\nadministration of CBT. Figure 4.1 shows the distribution on the performance of PBLs before\\nthe administration of CBT.\\n26\\nPoor\\n3 Poor\\nAverage\\nAverage\\nGood 8\\nGood\\nVery Good Very Good\\n4\\nExcellent\\nExcellent\\n4\\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30\\nFigure 4.1. Frequency Distribution on Performance of PBL\\nFigure 4.1, illustrates that 16 out of 45 PBL were performing well in school work, while 26\\nwere not performing well, and 3 were performing on an average rate. The result shows that\\nPBLs were not performing well because of the many challenges they were faced after the death\\nof their parent(s) as indicated in Table 4.1. In order to get more understanding on the\\nperformance, PBL were interviewed using interview schedules (refer to question 3 appendices\\nA) and the following was an excerpt from one of the PBL.\\nMadam, since the death of my parents, things have never been the same. My performance has\\nreally been affected the past two years. Despite the fact that they registered me with the social\\n37\\nwelfare for support, I do not receive any support. Sometimes I don\\u2019t even come to school when\\nI have no transport money\\nBesides, another PBL said that:\\n\\u201cI have a big challenge with school fees and uniforms. This has affected my performance in\\nschool because in most cases, I am not in school. My aunt tries to assist me, but she fails to\\nprovide all the materials for my school. This uniform I am wearing was bought for me when I\\nstarted grade ten. This year I am now in grade 12, I have grown big and my uniform is very\\nsmall on me. The school shoes I am wearing are not even meant to be worn as school uniform,\\nand for this reason, the school authority which includes the teacher on duty and the school\\nprefects are always on me to punish me for wearing wrong shoes. This lowers my self-esteem\\nand leads me to withdraw myself from interacting with my friends, because some of my friends\\nmock me.\\u201d (Interviewed- October, 2017)\\nIn order to respond to the same question, another PBL said:\\n\\u201cAs you look at me madam, I am a parent on my own. I have no one to help me with my\\neducation. My school reports have poor results because I have to do piece works to sustain my\\nlivelihood. My parents died when I was a little boy and since that time I have been living with\\nmy grandmother. I just keep imagining how they used to look like. Sometimes I wander a lot\\nwhen I think about my parents. May be I should just follow them. Life is very difficult for me\\nand because I have no one to help me in challenging situations. Sometimes I go for days without\\neating nshima and this lowers my morale to be in class. If I have a challenging piece work,\\nsometimes I abandon lessons.\\nThe responses from the PBL indicated that they were facing many challenges which adversely\\naffected their academic performance. Several excerpts from the PBL suggested that they had a\\nnumber of challenges as illustrated in Table 4.1.\\n4.3.2. Relationship with Friends\\nTo solicit for more information on the behaviour and academic performance of learners, the\\nrespondents were also asked to state their relationship with friends after the death of their\\nparents in line with question 1 on the questionnaire (see Appendix B). The results obtained\\nwere as shown in Figure 4.2 before the administration of CBT.\\n35\\n30\\n30\\n25 Excellent\\n20 Very Good\\n15 Good\\n10\\n10 Average\\n5 3 Poor\\n1 1\\n0\\nExcellent Very Good Good Average Poor\\n38\\nFrom the frequency distribution in Figure 4.2, it was perceptible that out of 45 PBL, only 5\\nPBL were doing well in terms of relationship, while 30 PBL were not and 10 PBL\\u2019s relationship\\nwith friends was on average. Similarly, the PBL were interviewed in order to obtain more\\ninformation on relationship with friends by the use of the interview schedule (see Appendices\\nA, question 5). This is evident from what one of the PBL said;\\nSome of my classmates like teasing me and they laugh at me for wearing shoes which is not\\npart of the school uniform. They humiliate me and this makes me feel embarrassed. This has\\nled me to disassociate myself from everyone in class.\\nIn response to the same question this is what another PBL said\\nMadam many people including our classmates and teachers look down upon us, they call us\\nname such as \\u201corphans\\u201d, and that\\u2019s the reason we don\\u2019t interact.\\nFrom the PBL responses, it was apparent that PBL felt stigmatised and discriminated\\nagainst by whoever referred to them as \\u2018orphans\\u2019. This prevented them from having\\nany significant relationship with anyone who called as such.\\n4.3.3. PBL Participation in Class at Pre-Test Before the Administration of CBT\\nPBL participation in class was also assessed and Figure 4.3 illustrates the results on their\\nparticipation. A questionnaire and an observation checklist were used to assess PBL\\nparticipation in class (refer to appendices B and C).\\n1\\n5 Very Good\\n5\\nGood\\nAverage\\n34\\nPoor\\nFigure 4.3: Frequency distribution on participation in class\\nFigure 4.3 shows the frequency distribution in terms of participation in class for PBL at pre-\\ntest. Participation in class usually means students speaking in class: answer and ask questions,\\nmake comments, and join in discussions. It was observed that majority PBL were not\\n39\\nparticipative in class. For instance, 21 out of 45 PBL were not participative in class while 13\\nout of 45 PBL were neutral and 11 out of 45 agreed to be participative in class. Therefore,\\nfrom the illustrations above, it can be noted that lack of participation and poor relationship in\\nschool also contributed to the poor academic performance by PBL before the administration\\nof CBT (refer to Figure 4.1 and Figure 4.2). The other reason could be that PBL were not\\nconfident enough because of the challenges they were going through after the death of their\\nparents as illustrated in Table 4.2.\\nThe findings of this study shows that PBL experienced many challenges as expressed in Table\\n4.2. The findings from behavioural observations and academic performance also indicated that\\nPBL had many challenges which affected their psychosocial wellbeing. This study also\\nrevealed that PBL had difficulties in adapting to social environments in and outside the\\nclassroom. This adversely affected their mental wellbeing and academic performance. These\\nchallenges were hypothesized for the whole group and a group CBT was deliberated as an\\neffective therapy to reduce the aforementioned challenges.\\nBasing on the findings of this study, a description of the treatment course was provided for the\\nwhole group after the pre-test observations. Specific cognitive behavioural interventions and\\nexposures addressing each post bereavement challenge and complicating factors were\\nexplored. The effectiveness of these exposures were determined by; each PBL level of\\nemotional distress and ease of completing the exposure. Treatment outcomes were provided\\nfor the group and were assessed for significance through qualitative and quantitative methods\\nof analysis.\\nThe sessions for CBT were 12 every week, lasting 45-60 minutes. The sessions were structured\\nindicating specific set of topics to cover in each session. These topics targeted the specific post-\\nbereavement challenges that were in line with the common emerged themes. Group members\\nwere encouraged to think about the material presented to them, and also to share on how it\\napplied to their thoughts and experiences with it. PBL were also expected to practice the skills\\ntaught in the group.\\nIn order for CBT to be a highly effective psychological treatment for PBL, all the 45 group\\nmembers were encouraged to attend, participate and do between session homework exercises.\\nBetween sessions homework was assigned every week, because CBT is a skills-based\\napproach, the skills one learns in session each week was to be practiced throughout the week.\\n40\\nWhat participants did between sessions counted as much or more than what they did in session.\\nParticipants in this group were encouraged not to miss a single session but to be committed to\\ndevoting time and energy between sessions to applying what they had learnt. This really helped\\nto reduce their anxiety and improved their overall psychological functioning.\\nAll the 45 PBL learners were primarily treated for post-bereavement challenges following the\\ndeath of their parent(s). In this case, the therapist employed a CBT approach to make use of\\ncognitive-behavioural strategies while maintaining a focus on post-bereavement challenges\\nand academic performance. The therapist explained to PBL that post-bereavement challenges\\nwere a common and normal experience for those who lost loved ones. Additionally, it was\\nimportant for the group to know that there were external events and circumstances that could\\ntrigger a grief reaction. To increase awareness of specific triggers, post bereaved learners were\\nencouraged to prepare for them. Although all the group participants were free to talk about\\nthe group in a general way, it was agreed by group members to keep others\\u2019 information private\\nand confidential. This helped everyone feel safe sharing in group. A Group CBT was an\\neffective way to reduce symptoms of anxiety with the added benefit that participants meet\\nothers who were struggling with the same concerns.\\nIn this study, PBL responded well to CBT according to the post observations and interviews\\nrecorded by the researcher. PBL were asked to take their own self-examinations regarding\\ntheir interactions, moods, attitudes, performance, participation and concentration in class.\\nPost bereaved earners were asked to: (1) Identify negative thoughts, especially the ones that\\nhad the potential to cause harm to self and/or others. (2) Post bereaved learners were taught to\\nchallenge their negative thoughts beginning with the evaluation of their own perceptions. This\\ninvolved questioning practicality, analysing positive beliefs and testing reality. A number of\\nexperiments and counselling sessions were conducted to make their minds believe that\\nnegative thoughts were baseless. (3) Post bereaved learners were encouraged to replace\\nnegative thoughts with more realistic and positive ones to seal the therapeutic approach. While\\nthe therapist helped learners to come up with rational and accurate thoughts; it was the affected\\nindividual that must derive positive thoughts so that their anxiety levels were reduced to\\nnormalcy.\\nIn this study, PBL were trained in copying skills. The copying skills for the group were a form\\nof brief, structured group psychotherapy in which the PBL were taught a variety of cognitive\\nbehavioural techniques to be used for reducing post bereavement psychosocial challenges and\\n41\\nfor copying more effectively with the problems and stresses of everyday life. The cognitive\\nbehavioural techniques incorporated into the group therapy program were cognitive\\nrestructuring, problem solving, relaxation, and assertiveness training. These were carefully\\nchosen to provide participants with a complementally set of copying strategies on which they\\nwere able to draw when dealing with current problems and with a broad range of potential\\nfuture problems. The following were some of the CBT copying skills: Deep breathing, self-\\nmonitoring, behavioural action, decision making, cognitive restructuring plus setting and\\nmanaging goals, The PBL were trained to apply in their everyday life to overcome\\ndysfunctional thinking during and after the administration of CBT.\\n4.3.3.1 Deep Breathing Technique\\nPost bereaved learners were trained in breath taking which is a very basic cognitive-behavioural\\ntherapy coping strategy for managing anxiety. It was a simple technique, but very powerful.\\n4.3.3.2 Self-Monitoring Technique\\nPost-bereaved learners were also trained in self-monitoring skills, which is a very basic\\ncognitive-behavioural therapy coping strategy. This skill is at the core of all of the cognitive-\\nbehavioural coping strategies described in this study. In order to address a problem or a\\nsymptom, there was need for post bereaved learners to first become aware of it. There were a\\nnumber of steps to self-monitoring; however, the steps were easily learnt and quickly applied\\nto their lives.\\n4.3.3.3 Behavioural Activation Technique\\nPost bereaved learners were also trained in behavioural activation technique. This technique is\\nanchored on the belief that, those that felt depressed or anxious, were less likely to do the things\\nthey enjoy, and therefore, it was important for them to learn how to be more active. Behavioral\\nactivation was a way to do this. The goal of behavioural activation was simple. It just helps\\npeople get more active in areas of their life that are pleasurable and enjoyable. Being more\\nconnected and involved with these experiences improves one\\u2019s mood.\\n42\\n4.3.3.4 Decision-Making: Weighing Pros and Cons\\nPost bereaved learners were trained on how to weigh pros and cons whenever they were faced\\nwith a decision, which made them, feel paralyzed or trapped. They may not be able to know\\nwhat the best choice could be, but one way to move forward was to weigh the short- and long-\\nterm pros and cons of a situation. Doing so helped them to identify the best path (that is, a path\\nthat is associated with low risk and was consistent with the goals and priorities) to take.\\n4.3.3.5 Cognitive Restructuring\\nPost bereaved learners were also trained on the cognitive restructuring technique, which is also\\na common cognitive-behavioural coping strategy. In this technique post bereaved learners were\\ntaught how to evaluate and think about themselves, other people and events that had a major\\nimpact on their mood. Cognitive restructuring focuses on identifying negative thoughts or\\nevaluations and modifying them. This was achieved by gathering evidence for and against\\ncertain thoughts. By modifying their thoughts, post bereaved learners were able to improve\\ntheir moods and make better choices with regard to behaviours.\\n4.3.3.6 Setting and Managing Goals\\nPost bereaved learners were taught on how to set goals in life. Goals (or things that one wants\\nto accomplish in the future) can give someone a life purpose and direction, as well as motivate\\nhealthy behaviours focused on improving one\\u2019s life. The importance of goal setting was very\\nmuch emphasized, and participants responded very well because they realized they had no\\ngoal\\u2019s they were pursuing, and much of their thinking was centred on post bereavement and\\norphanhood. Participants were taught to set goals and approach them in a way that improves\\ntheir mood and quality of life, as opposed to increasing distress.\\nAfter the administration of CBT all participants responded well to coping skills according to\\nthe post observation which was carried out with the same research instruments. The\\nobservations were mandatory because the researcher wanted to know whether the participants\\nwere responding well to the treatment of CBT and its copying skills or not. This enabled the\\nresearcher to find out whether the objectives of the study were achieved or not. Since the CBT\\nsessions lasted only for a certain number of weeks, after which participants were expected to\\n43\\nhave gained enough skills to continue on their own, it was necessary for the researcher to\\nexamine whether CBT had really worked or not. The program was therefore in a very real\\nsense preventive as well as remedial.\\n4.4. Evaluation of the efficacy of CBT in Improving the Performance of Learners\\nExperiencing Post-Bereavement Challenges.\\nAfter the administration of CBT as an intervention on learners experiencing post bereavement\\nchallenges, PBLs were subjected to a post-test observation to assess the efficacy of CBT on\\ntheir performance. The same instruments used at pre-test were also implemented at post-test as\\nshown in Figure 4.3 and the following were the recordings and observations.\\n2\\n3\\nAverage\\n22\\nVery Good\\nExcellent\\n18\\nPoor\\nFigure 4.3 shows the frequency distribution of PBLs academic performance after the\\nadministration of CBT as an intervention to the challenges they were facing after the death of\\ntheir parent(s). The PBLs post-test results on performance scored 40 out of 45 PBLs, while at\\npre-test performance was 16 out of 45 PBLs. PBLs also scored on confidence and concentration\\nwere also different at pre and post-test after the administration of CBT. This shows that PBLs\\nhad improved in behaviour and academic performance after the administration of CBT. This is\\nwhat one PBL said after the post-test observation:\\nMadam, many things have changed in my life after CBT training. My performance in class has\\nimproved; I pay attention whenever I am in class. I am able to concentrate on my studies. Today\\nI can confidently contribute in class during lessons. Thanks so much for teaching us on how to\\nembrace positive thoughts.\\n44\\nThe PBL were also rated in the manner they interacted with their friends in school. The\\nfollowing Figure 4.5. illustrates the frequency distribution on the relationship with\\nfriends.\\nFigure 4.5\\n1\\nPoor\\n4\\nAverage Poor\\nAverage\\nGood 3\\nGood\\nVery Good\\nVery Good\\n25\\nExcellent\\nExcellent\\n12\\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30\\nFigure 4.5 shows the frequency distribution on the relationship with friends of PBLs after the\\nadministration of CBT on the challenges they were facing after the death of their parent(s). The\\nfrequency distribution on the relationship with friends scored 40 out of 45 PBL.\\nThe PBL\\u2019s Classroom Participation was also observed and the following results\\nillustrated in Figure 4.6 were recorded.\\nFigure 4.6.\\n1\\n3 Excellent\\n15\\nVery Good\\n14\\nGood\\n11 Average\\nPoor\\nFigure 4.6 shows the Frequency distribution on the participation of PBLs at post-test after the\\nadministration of CBT as an intervention to the post bereavement challenges. PBLs scored 30\\nout of 45 in terms of participation in class.\\n45\\nAfter the administration of CBT and training in CBT copying skills, PBLs were interviewed\\non how they felt about the bereavement challenges they were experiencing after the death of\\ntheir parent(s). Below is what one PBL said:\\nThese days I am a changed person both at home and in school. My relationship with friends and\\nfamily members has changed. I no longer exhibit anger towards my friends. My moods have\\nimproved. I am very hopeful of a brighter future.\\nBesides this, another PBL said:\\nThe CBT therapy has helped me to develop cognitive strategies such as questioning and\\nchallenging my thinking, and looking at situations from different perspectives. I developed CBT\\nstrategies and tools to deal with things that were keeping me depressed, lowering my moods\\nand increasing sense of hopelessness. My confidence and self-esteem have improved and the\\ntherapy helped in a positive way. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this service\\u2026\\nResponding to the same interview, another PBL said:\\nHaving CBT sessions has given me the tools and confidence I need to cope better especially\\nwhen faced with difficulties. I have learnt so many ways to worry less, especially about the\\nfuture. CBT has helped make daily life easier, and I never thought I could do something to stop\\nmy worrying.\\n4.5 Summary\\nThe findings of this study shows that PBL faced challenges comprising lower self-esteem as a\\nresult of not having biological parents, stigmatised both in school and at home by the label\\n\\u201corphan\\u201d, fear of being rejected by the guardians and memorable reminders of their deceased\\nparents. The other challenges included feeling of negative emotions such as sadness, frustration\\nand pain, depression as a result of parental death, lack of love from already burdened care\\ngivers and stress as a result of walking long distances to and from school. The administration\\nof CBT to PBLs as well as inculcation of coping skills indicates favourable responses. The\\nPBL gained enough skills to continue on their own. The program was therefore in a very real\\nsense preventive as well as remedial. After the administration of CBT there was an\\nimprovement in the behavioural and academic performance of learners as observed from the\\npre and post test results.\\n46\\nCHAPTER FIVE\\nDISCUSSION OF THE FINDINGS\\n5.1 Overview\\nThis chapter discusses the findings of the study. The discussion is divided in three parts\\naccording to the research objectives. The research objectives were; to identify the challenges\\npost -bereaved learners were faced with after the death of their parent(s), to administer CBT as\\nan intervention in improving the academic performance of learners experiencing post\\nbereavement challenges, and to assess the efficacy of CBT in improving the academic\\nperformance of learners experiencing post bereavement challenges.\\n5.2. Challenges post bereaved learners were faced with after the death of their\\nparent(s)\\nIn order to establish the challenges PBL were faced with after the death of their parent(s), an\\ninterview guide, observation checklist, a questionnaire, FGD checklist and a document analysis\\nchecklist were used. The findings of this study indicated that PBL were exposed to quite a\\nsubstantial number of post bereavement challenges that impacted their mental wellbeing and\\nacademic performance negatively. Some of the notable post bereavement challenges which\\nwere identified among PBL are as follows: absenteeism from school, stress as a result of\\nwalking long distances to and from school, lack of finances to cater for school basic resources,\\nlower self-esteem as a result of not having biological parents and being labelled as \\u201corphans\\u201d\\nboth in school and at home, lack of love and care from their guardians which led some\\nparticipant to engage in intimacy relationships, depression due to lack of representation by\\nguardians in school activities, sporadic moods as a result of hibernating negative emotions such\\nas sadness, frustration and pain, illicit substance abuse due to lack of parental control and worry\\nas a result of daily life struggles, lack of food and fear of being rejected by the guardian.\\nThese findings are in agreement with Youth\\u2019s (2014) intensive review of case on revealed\\nbereavement themes that contributed to bereavement-related distress. In his findings,\\ndepressive dysfunctional thoughts about the self, life, and the world; specific anxious\\ndysfunctional thoughts about the grief reaction; fear of abandonment; depressive avoidant\\nbehaviours, such as withdrawal from relationships or activities; avoidance of loss reminders;\\n47\\nand problems integrating the loss, were bereavement themes found to be prominent in the\\nearlier part of treatment and were targeted using cognitive behavioural interventions, including\\nbereavement-related exposures, behavioural activation, and proactive problem solving skills.\\nThese findings are also supported by Worden\\u2019s (1996), from the Harvard Bereavement Study\\nof \\u2018late effects\\u2019 of child bereavement with differences in the levels of clinical difficulty between\\nparentally bereaved school-aged children and their non-bereaved. Nonetheless, it should be\\nnoted that most of the findings in this study such as lack of finances to cater for school basic\\nneeds, worry as a result of daily life struggles, lack of food and fear of being rejected by the\\nguardian and the school, pose a threat to the security needs category of a human being. Human\\nbeings at all times strive to be safe and secured. Any form of insecurity in the environment may\\ntrigger anxieties. If these needs are not met, the mental wellbeing of a person especially a PBL\\ncannot be sound and cannot perform to expected academic standards.\\nThe findings in this study, also established that PBL had lower self-esteem as a result of not\\nhaving biological parents and being labelled as \\u201corphan (s)\\u201d both in school and at home. This\\nrestricted PBL in the circles of interactions and relationships. On the other hand, PBL were\\nfound to be depressed due to lack of representation by guardians in school activities; this in\\nturn affected their moods as a result of hibernating negative emotions such as sadness,\\nfrustration and pain regarding guardian representation. This affected PBL psychosocially as\\nthey posed a threat to the self-esteem needs category. The feeling of self-worth which is very\\ncrucial to every human being was quite compromised. Any form of threat to the self-esteem or\\nself -worth of a person induces anxieties. These anxieties may be a risk factor to mental illness\\nof a person. In order to address these challenges, CBT was administered to the participants in\\nthis study.\\nThe findings in this study especially on the PBL moods as a result of hibernating negative\\nemotions such as sadness, frustration and pain are in line with the symptoms of post\\nbereavement listed on an online publication (Think CBT 2018), in which the most common\\npsychological and emotional symptoms of post bereavement included emotional detachment,\\nnumbness, shock, disbelief, and denial, often occurring immediately following the loss. In line\\nwith this study, we can say that the anger, moody, lack of attention and concentration exhibited\\nby the PBL were a result of the common psychological and symptoms of post bereavement\\nchallenges which needed immediate CBT intervention in order to avoid the acceleration of\\nthese problems.\\n48\\nAlthough its traditionally the human tendency to think irrationally following a death event,\\nbecause bereaved individuals think that the death should not have happened to them, or that it\\nis too painful for them to stand, others also think it\\u2019s embarrassing for them to lose a loved one,\\nthere is always a way out of these irrational thoughts, and the answer lies in the administration\\nof CBT. Many research studies also show that mental changes occur following such a death\\n(Boelen et al., Kip et al., 2004; Boelen et al., 2003). This elucidates that many people who have\\nexperienced the death of a loved one often experience severe anger, deny or protest the loss\\nand undergo significant periods of anxiety and depression which if not well treated may result\\nin mental health problems. PBLs in this study were not exceptional and that\\u2019s why they were\\ngiven the much needed attention by applying CBT as intervention, and it was successful.\\nThe findings of this study also revealed that most PBL were not provided with counsel after\\nexperiencing the death of their parent(s). PBL were supposed to be inducted in the whole\\nprocess of adaption to bereavement from the cognitive perspective. In this way post bereaved\\nlearners could have the ability to adapt their thoughts to new situations; difficulties in doing so\\nindicated dominancy of irrational beliefs that enhanced the risk of complicated post\\nbereavement. This is in line with the study which was conducted by Boelen et al., (2004) in\\nwhich the relationship between loss and irrational beliefs in a group of 30 students who were\\ngrieving the loss of a parent or a sibling was examined against a control group of 30 non-\\nbereaved individuals. The objective of the study was to trace the relationship between beliefs\\nand emotional responses, and whether a loss affects the cognitive process.\\n5.3. Administration of CBT in Improving the Academic Performance of PBL\\nThe major goal of administering CBT to the PBL in this study was aimed at improving their\\nacademic performance and the mental wellbeing after experiencing the death of their parent(s).\\nThe CBT model emphasizes that reason, a product of thinking, and emotion in psychotherapy\\nis a comprehensive method of treating human disturbances. This model stresses that people\\nfeel according to what they think, that is, thoughts and cognitive constructions are at the root\\nof emotions and behaviour patterns. The application of this model in this current study was to\\naddress dysfunctional thought using functional analysis in CBT\\nIn this study, based on the findings from the participants, it was realized that most PBLs\\nbehaved in the manner they did because of their bereavement experiences and the transitioning\\nof events they went through after the death of their parent(s). In order to address their concerns,\\n49\\nPBL were subjected to an overhaul cognitive restructuring process which required significant\\neffort to avoid risks of mental disorders like social anxiety disorder (SAD).\\nAccording to Beck (2006), cognitive behavioural therapy deals with ones cognition (thoughts)\\nand behaviour. The two, that is thoughts and behaviour, do interact (Beck, 2006). In this\\ncurrent study, the thoughts and grievances about the life and the identity that PBLs learners\\nexperienced so suddenly and unexpectedly triggered post bereavement related stress which\\nconsequently also triggered negative thoughts. In this current study, the administration of CBT\\non PBLs was focused on helping them to identify and deal with such negative thoughts and\\nfeelings that lead to undesirable behaviours. This is in agreement with the finding of Laidlaw\\net al., (2010).\\nDuring the administration of CBT, PBLs were subjected to CBT coping skills. Copying skills\\nsuch as cognitive behavioural techniques were incorporated in the group therapy program. This\\nincluded cognitive restructuring techniques, problem solving techniques, relaxation, and\\nassertiveness training. These copying skills were carefully chosen to provide the PBLs with a\\ncomplementally set of copying strategies on which they were able to draw when dealing with\\ncurrent problems and with a broad range of potential future problems.\\nThe findings of this study also show that all PBL responded well to CBT coping skills during\\nand after the administration. These copying skills training were mandatory to this study and\\nthe PBL because they were used to assess efficacy of CBT on PBL, and also to evaluate whether\\nthe participants responded well to CBT and its copying skills or not. The following were some\\nof the CBT copying skills PBL acquired during the study; PBL were trained in breath taking\\nwhich is a very basic cognitive-behavioural therapy coping strategy for managing anxiety.\\nPBLs were also mentored on self-monitoring skills which was a very basic cognitive-\\nbehavioural therapy coping strategy, which is at the core of all of the cognitive-behavioural\\ncoping strategies described in this study. In order to address a problem or a symptom, there\\nwas need for participants to first become aware of it. There were a number of steps to self-\\nmonitoring; however, the steps were easily learnt and quickly applied to their lives. PBLs were\\nalso exposed to behavioural activation techniques. This technique is anchored on the belief\\nthat, those that felt depressed or anxious, were less likely to do the things they enjoy, and\\ntherefore, it was important for them to learn how to be more active. Behavioral activation was\\nthe only way to do this. The goal of behavioural activation was simple. It helped PBL to get\\n50\\nmore active in areas of their life that were pleasurable and enjoyable. Being more connected\\nand involved with these experiences improved the psychosocial life and moods of the PBL.\\nThe PBL were also encouraged to weigh pros and cons whenever they were faced with a\\ndecision, which made them, feel paralyzed or trapped. They may not be able to know what the\\nbest choice could be, but one way to move forward was to weigh the short- and long-term pros\\nand cons of a situation. Doing so helped them to identify the best path (that is, a path that is\\nassociated with low risk and was consistent with the goals and priorities) to take. PBL were\\nalso subjected to the cognitive restructuring technique, which is also a common cognitive-\\nbehavioural coping strategy. In this technique PBL were taught how to evaluate and think about\\nthemselves, other people and events that had a major impact on their mood. Cognitive\\nrestructuring focuses on identifying negative thoughts or evaluations and modifying them. This\\nwas achieved by gathering evidence for and against certain thoughts. By modifying their\\nthoughts, PBL were able to improve their moods and make better choices with regard to\\nbehaviours. Lastly, PBL were encouraged to set goals in life. Goals (or things that one wants\\nto accomplish in the future) can give someone a life purpose and direction, as well as motivate\\nhealthy behaviours focused on improving one\\u2019s life. The importance of goal setting was very\\nmuch emphasized and PBL responded very well because they realized they had no goal\\u2019s they\\nwere pursuing, and much of their thinking was cantered on post bereavement and orphanhood.\\nPBL were taught to set goals and approach them in a way that improves their mood and quality\\nof life, as opposed to increasing distress.\\nIn this current study, learners were provided with multiple opportunities to practice CBT\\ncopying skills. In order to change maladaptive habitual impulsivity, PBLs were encouraged to\\ncreate opportunities to practice CBT skills. In this current study, CBT had proved to have very\\nstrong and positive effects on PBLs because it did not only improve and build their confidence\\nbut it also enhanced their daily lifestyle through a range of activities as postulated by Rector\\n(2010) in his findings.\\nAccording to the research findings, practicing CBT as a group allowed a wider source of\\nfeedback, and engaged the entire group in the process of learning and reinforcing new skills.\\nPBLs in the group CBT therapy showed greater openness to the feedback of fellow group\\nmembers. Despite the PBL previous histories, all the group members generally offered\\nconstructive feedback by encouraging pro-social solutions by their peers, at the same time,\\nreviewing the previous or anticipated results of constructive behaviours provided an\\n51\\nopportunity to \\u201celicit change talk;\\u201d the more PBL hear themselves state the benefits of\\nconstructive change, the more they reinforced their belief in the benefits of pro-social change.\\n5.4. The Effect of CBT in Improving the Academic Performance of PBL\\nTo assess the efficacy of CBT in improving the academic performance and mental wellbeing\\nof PBL experiencing post-bereavement challenges, the findings in this study shows that PBLs\\nwere subjected to pre-test before the administration of CBT and post-test after the\\nadministration of CBT. PBLs were assessed in performance in class; relationship with others\\nin school and participation in class. PBL scored low in almost all aspects of interest at pre-test,\\nbefore the administration of CBT. For instance, the scores of PBLs\\u2019 performance at pre-test\\nshowed PBL scoring 16 out of 45. This implies that only 35% scored highly. While at the\\nsecond test, which was post-test, after the administration of CBT, the results on performance\\nshowed PBLs scoring 40 out of 45 PBL. This indicates there was an improved equivalent to\\nabove 88 % improvement in scores compared to what was scored at pre-test. Similarly, the\\nresults on PBL relationship with others at pre-test showed 5 out 45 PBL relating well with\\nothers, while at post-test after the administration of CBT the score were much higher with PBL\\nscoring 40 out 45 compared to the scores at pre-test. Correspondingly, the results of PBL\\nparticipation class at pre-test shows 5 out 45 PBL were participative in class. After the\\nadministration of CBT, the scores of PBL at post-test were 30 out 45 compared to the scores at\\npre-test. All the post tests conducted on the PBL after the administration of CBT showed\\nimprovements in the manner the PBL were scoring compared to the results scored at pre-test\\nbefore the administration of CBT regarding the challenges the PBL were facing after the death\\nof their parent(s). Although the post-test results indicated a marked improvement in scores, that\\nis above the previous scores, there was still a small number of PBL that did not score well in\\nterms of performance in class, relating with others and participation in class. The PBL that\\nfailed to improve the academic performance and the mental wellbeing after the administration\\nof CBT did this on account of continued holding on to the grief, worse conditions in their\\nresidences and slow process of recovery. Despite that five (5) PBL failed to improve their\\nacademic performance and mental wellbeing after the administration of CBT, the results show\\nthat CBT was efficacious in the improvement of the mental wellbeing and academic\\nperformance of PBL as indicated from the scores.\\n52\\n5.5 Summary\\nBased on the findings and discussions, it is perceived that the resultant behaviour exhibited by\\nthe PBLs in this study was attributed to by their faulty thought patterns after experiencing the\\ndeath of their parent(s). These faulty or dysfunctional thought patterns needed immediate\\ninterventions such as CBT, to replace them with functional thoughts that aimed at enhancing\\nmetal wellbeing and improved academic performance.\\n53\\nCHAPTER SIX\\nSUMMARY, CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS\\n6.1 Overview\\nIn this chapter the summary of the study is given. Conclusions drawn from the investigations\\nare also outlined. In addition, recommendations based on the findings are presented. The\\nchapter ends up with suggestions for further research.\\n6.2. Summary\\nThis study investigated the efficacy of Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy as an intervention to\\nimprove the academic performance and mental wellbeing of learners experiencing post-\\nbereavement challenges. The study objectives were: To identify the challenges post bereaved\\nlearners were faced with after the death of their parent(s), to administer CBT as an intervention\\nin improving the academic performance of learners experiencing post bereavement challenges,\\nand to determine the efficacy of CBT in improving the academic performance of learners\\nexperiencing post bereavement challenges.\\nBased on the findings, the study established that PBL at Luanshya School for Continuing\\nEducation were faced with many challenges after the death of their parent(s). These challenges\\nwere; absenteeism from school, stress as a result of walking long distances to and from school,\\nlack of finances to cater for school needs, lower self-esteem as a result of not having biological\\nparents and being labelled as \\u201corphans\\u201d both in school and at home, lack of love and care from\\ntheir guardians which led some participant to engage in intimacy relationships, depression due\\nto lack of representation by guardians in school activities, sporadic moods as a result of\\nhibernating negative emotions such as sadness, frustration and pain, illicit substance abuse due\\nto lack of parental control, worry as a result of daily life struggles, lack of food and fear of\\nbeing rejected by the guardian. These post-bereavement challenges affected the PBL academic\\nperformance and mental wellbeing as they were stressful enough to distract the learner\\u2019s\\nattention, concentration, performance, and participation in classroom activities.\\n54\\n6.3. Conclusion\\nThe findings of this study have implications pointing out the importance of parental presence\\nand affection for children. Findings from this study are very important from a psychosocial\\npoint of view suggesting that the caregivers of the PBL without parents must have some special\\nconsiderations while dealing with these individuals. This may ensure the inculcation of healthy\\npsychosocial functioning in PBL that may in turn lead them to better adapt to the societal\\ndemands regarding post bereavement challenges.\\nThe findings in this study imply that there is need for more psychotherapists in schools and\\nmore specific knowledge in general on the devastating effects of bereavement on post bereaved\\nlearner\\u2019s mental wellbeing, strategies that aims at improving their academic performance, as\\nwell as insights into the individual\\u2019s functioning, to alleviate depressive symptoms of post\\nbereavement. The content of CBT in terms of concrete home assignments and behavioural\\nactivation needs to be individualized.\\nIn this study we have addressed complications of post bereavement which from the perspective\\nof CBT denotes difficulties in changes in the beliefs and the adaptation to a reality that excludes\\nthe deceased, as this difficulty points to the preservation of irrational beliefs and aggravates the\\ndevelopment of complications such as depression, anxiety, guilt and unhealthy anger. The CBT\\ntherapeutic intervention is directed at facilitating the adaptive process to post bereavement\\nstressful factors including changes in irrational-rational thoughts.\\nThe findings of the study revealed that leaners experienced many post bereavement challenges.\\nThe prevalence of post bereavement stress factors gives counsellors and administrators\\nassignments to look into how best post bereavement challenges should be attended to among\\npost bereaved learners at any point in time as post bereavement challenges results into elicit\\nbehaviour.\\n6.4. Recommendations\\nIn order to improve the mental wellbeing and academic performance of learners at Luanshya\\nSchool for Continuing Education, post-bereaved leaners should be identified continuously and\\nbe provided with necessary needs at any given point in time whenever such situations arises.\\n55\\n\\uf0b7 The Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Health should corroborate, and intensify\\non therapist training efforts through deliberately creating technical positions for\\ncounsellors and psychologists in schools.\\n\\uf0b7 This also indicates the need for imparting training in CBT to the teaching staff dealing\\nwith post bereaved learners and other vulnerable learners who are prone to different\\ncircumstances, so that they can intervene early in the course of the challenge with the\\nview to control it.\\n\\uf0b7 To sustain implementation through staff turnover, learning institutions should increase\\nstaff turnover by providing teachers with CBT skills that are in high demand within the\\ncommunity.\\n\\uf0b7 To improve wide-scale dissemination, research should continue to identify cost-\\neffective ways to develop therapist competencies, such as through blended training\\nmodels or computer simulations, as well as identify key characteristics of staff most\\nlikely to develop adequate competence.\\n\\uf0b7 Research on the significant impact of CBT on the improvement of the mental wellbeing\\nand academic performance of PBLs suggests there\\u2019s need for an effective public health\\napproach.\\n6.5. Proposed Areas for Future Research\\nSince this study was conducted in one school in Luanshya. The researcher recommends that\\nanother study be conducted in a different setting in particular the rural area and thereby be\\nreplicated on other schools to see if additional information could be provided regarding CBT\\non learners experiencing post bereavement challenges.\\n56\\nReference\\nAbdelnoor, A. & Hollins, S.

Ilubala-Ziwa, Gilbert Kamanga, J. Musonda and Maligelita, J. Njobvu\\nAbstract\\nThe impact of the declaration of Zambia as a Christian nation on Religious Education\\n(R.E.) can be looked at in terms of content, strategies and learners. In terms of content,\\nsome sections of society may consider R.E. as a means to overtly promote Christian\\nbeliefs, practices and ideologies. However, in Zambia schools comprise learners who\\nare religiously heterogeneous. Furthermore, the 1996 National Educational Policy\\nespouses liberal democratic values such as autonomy, liberty and fairness. The\\nobjectives of the study were to: establish the views of stakeholders on the declaration\\nof Zambia as a Christian nation and Religious Education; examine the impact which\\nthe declaration of Zambia as a Christian nation had on R.E. While most stakeholders\\nargued that R.E. should become more inclusive, others asserted that due to the\\ndeclaration of Zambia as a Christian nation, RE should be exclusive to Christianity.\\nThis trend, defeats the educational aim of R.E. which is, the acquisition of knowledge,\\nskills, attitudes and values. The dominance of a single religion in R.E. risks limiting\\nawareness of religious diversity and deprives learners a genuine space for dialogue\\nwith other religions. It was in this regard that the study investigated the perceptions of\\nsenior secondary school R.E. teachers, learners and religious leaders on the impact of\\nthe declaration of Zambia as a Christian nation on R.E. The study employed the\\nqualitative approach with interview and focus group discussion as methods of eliciting\\ndate from the respondents\\nKey Words: Christian, Declaration, Liberal, Nation, Religious Education,\\nZAMBIAN JOURNAL OF RELIGION AND CONTEMPORARY ISSUES\\n180\\n1.0 Background\\nIn modern society, the place of Religious Education (R.E.) in publicly-funded schools is a\\ncontentious issue (Coulby, 2010; Parerkh, 2006; Richardson, 2007; Zambeta, 2008). Some\\npeople argue that R.E. should not be included as a school subject but be treated as a private\\nmatter because its epistemic knowledge is not subject to dialectic verification, refutation or\\nfalsification (Parerkh, 2006; Richardson, 2007; Zambeta, 2008). At the other end of the\\nspectrum, other people make a case that R.E. which is open, inclusive and non-confessional,\\nshould have a place in public schools because it promotes values such as tolerance and co-\\nexistence amongst learners with diverse religious backgrounds (Richardson, 2007;\\nSimuchimba, 2004). The contestation becomes fierce in situations where religion is\\nsupposedly seen to be conflicting with the ideals of equality and freedom in the wake of\\nmodern society which is dynamic and evolving, always being influenced by other\\ncommunities (Osler and Starkey, 2005). To the contrary, inclusive and non-confessional RE\\nhas great potential to help learners from different religious, cultural and ethnic backgrounds\\nempathise and value their parallels and variations in diversity (Richardson, 2007).\\nAlthough Zambian R.E. syllabuses include other religions such as Indigenous Zambian\\nBeliefs, Islam and Hinduism, the two senior secondary school syllabus heavily lean on\\nChristianity thereby leaving other religions in the periphery in terms of content (Mujdrica,\\n1995). In a way, the content of the two R.E. syllabuses is in contrast with the threefold aims\\nof R.E. as articulated by Lahnemann (1985: 123) who argues that the aims of R.E. are to:\\nJudith L. Ilubala-Ziwa, et al\\nEnable learners to have a better knowledge of the religions they come from;\\ndevelop interest in other religions; and, have a better understanding of the\\nvalues and ways of life of learners who do not belong to their own religion.\\nTo achieve the aims of R.E. as stated above, the R.E. curriculum needs to take into\\naccount all the existing major religious traditions including other issues affecting modern\\nsociety. It is for this reason that some stakeholders have called for an inclusive type of R.E.\\ndevoid of confessional approach (Mujdrica, 1995; Simuchimba, 2004).\\nThe declaration of Zambia as a Christian nation is another issue of concern for R.E. It\\nis important for national leaders to guard against the imposition of any particular religion on\\nthe entire society in that it might lead to learners being denied the opportunity to learn\\ndifferent religious traditions. In the case of Zambia, the society is increasingly becoming\\nmulti-faith and multi-cultural (Simuchimba, 2004). Thus, the Republican constitution\\nshould be a neutral document that should not discriminate against atheists, agnostics or\\npagans, or those who believe in Islam, Judaism, Buddhism, Hinduism, Sikhism, Shintoism,\\nJainism and Baha\\u2019i faith. If left unchecked, such a declaration might have a twofold effect\\nin that it might lead to a feeling of religious superiority among the followers of the religion\\nthat have been accorded constitutional status and that of second class citizenry among the\\nothers.\\nLocated firmly within the discourse of the context of R.E. in Zambian modern society\\nwhich is becoming more multi-faith, multi-cultural, pluralistic and democratic\\n(Simuchimba, 2004), this study explored the impact of the 181\\nZAMBIAN JOURNAL OF RELIGION AND CONTEMPORARY ISSUES\\ndeclaration of Zambia as a Christian nation on R.E. Unlike Simuchimba\\u2019s (2004) study\\nwhich focused on examining how the declaration had been used by Evangelical churches\\nand ministries to justify calls for major policy changes in the Zambian society including the\\nreintroduction of Bible Knowledge in schools among other changes this study went a step\\nahead and interacted with R.E. teachers and learners to gather first-hand information on the\\nissue. This provided new knowledge on whether the declaration had an impact on R.E. or\\nnot.\\n2.0 Literature Review\\nReligious Education in Zambia has over the years evolved through different stages namely:\\npre-colonial, colonial and post-colonial periods. Prior to the encounter with missionaries,\\nindigenous people were fully involved in the religious dimension of life. Every aspect of\\nAfrican life was punctuated by religious experience. For instance, birth, puberty, marriage\\nceremony and death were accorded a spiritual significance (Snelson, 1974). Haar (1992)\\ncontends that African religious life was intertwined with all the facets of society, such as\\npolitical, economic, social and educational dimensions. Additionally, Dickson (1979) states\\nthat there is a strong attachment between African culture and religion so much that religion\\nenlighten the African life in its entirety. As such, religion is given so much prominence in\\nthe African setting that all activities, education and relationships are permeated by religious\\ndimensions (Bussia, 1964). Noteworthy, Snelson (1974) pointed out that religious teaching\\nwas centered on the supreme being, a remote but all-pervading Creator, and the more\\nintimate tribal gods who controlled the tribe\\u2019s fortune.182\\nJudith L. Ilubala-Ziwa, et al\\nWith the arrival of the early missionaries in Zambia (Northern Rhodesia) in 1883, the\\nprovision of education was closely linked with religion in the sense that the missionaries\\nused education as a tool for conversion of indigenous people to Christianity with different\\ndenominations providing dissimilar varieties of Christianity, some of which were perceived\\nto be fundamentally diverse from the others (Carmody, 2004). However, in April, 1924 the\\nBritish government took over the administration of Northern Rhodesia and declared it a\\nProtectorate which lasted up to 1964. In the church state relationship, the government\\nsought to collaborate with different missionaries to ensure that the role of religion was\\ntailored towards character building of the indigenous people (Carmody, 2004). This is\\nattested by the Education Policy in British Tropical Africa which indicates that:\\nThe greatest importance must be attached to religious teaching and moral\\ninstruction. Both in schools and in training colleges, they should be accorded an\\nequal standing with secular subjects. Such teaching must be related to the\\nconditions of life and to the daily experiences of the pupils. It should find\\nexpression in habits of self-discipline and loyalty to the community. With such\\nsafeguards, contact with civilization need not be injurious, or the introduction\\nof new religious ideas has a disruptive influence antagonistic to constituted\\nsecular authority (Carmody 2004: 109).\\nZambia attained its political independence from Britain in 1964. However, the paradigm of\\ndenominationalisation of Religious Education was perpetuated up to the 1970s as was the\\ncase in the colonial dispensation. Two parallel programmes in the running of Religious\\nEducation emerged. In church run schools, Religious Instruction 183\\nZAMBIAN JOURNAL OF RELIGION AND CONTEMPORARY ISSUES\\n(RI) as R.E. was called then, was timetabled and taught like any other subjects, while in\\ngovernment schools, the subject was not on the main timetable but was taught after normal\\nclasses by different religious leaders from different denominations (Kamanga, 2013). In\\neither case, R.E. was, nevertheless, meant to promote religious absolutism. The beliefs and\\nvalues of one religion were taken as absolute truth hence Religious Education could be said\\nto have been confessional, doctrinal, and exclusivist in nature. In the light of\\ndenominational R.E., each denomination had its own Religious Instruction (RI) syllabus for\\nprimary and junior secondary school, while the Cambridge Bible Knowledge syllabus\\ncontinued to be used at senior secondary school level (Simuchimba, 2004). Owing to\\noperational challenges, however, the authorities sought to remedy this scenario by\\nchallenging different churches to develop an interdenominational Religious Education\\nsyllabus which was to be implemented throughout the nation irrespective of the school\\u2019s\\nreligious background (Mujdrica, 1995; Simuchimba, 2004). The decision was made in a\\ndeliberate effort towards the provision of meaningful and relevant education to the Zambian\\nsociety because curriculum design is developed with awareness of its philosophical position\\nand links to what society believes is important for children to learn (Colby, 1983).\\nThe growth of an ecumenical Religious Education in Zambia can, to a large extent, be\\nattributed to the Gaba Pastoral Institute of Uganda (Smith, 1982). In consultations with\\ndifferent churches and lecturers from various Teachers\\u2019 colleges in Zambia, the institute\\ndeveloped two syllabuses namely; \\u2018Developing in Christ\\u2019 for junior secondary schools and\\n\\u2018Christian Living Today\\u2019 for senior secondary schools. The aim of R.E. then was to\\ncontribute fully to the life and development of the 184\\nJudith L. Ilubala-Ziwa, et al\\ncountry by molding mature and responsible students (Carmody, 2004; Masterton,\\n1987; Mujdrica, 1995). In 1975, the new syllabuses were put into operation in the Zambian\\nschools. At junior secondary school, the syllabus consisted of \\u2018Developing in Christ\\u2019 was\\ntaught in form One and Two and a Zambian Supplement taught in form Three with\\n\\u2018Christian Living Today\\u2019 adopted at form Four and Five level. In this manner, Christian\\nLiving Today became an alternative syllabus to the Cambridge Bible Knowledge Syllabus\\nwhich was before then, the only Religious Education syllabus offered in secondary schools\\n(Mujdrica, 1995).\\nPerhaps, a major shift in the educational system was witnessed in 1977 following the\\neducational reforms which the government instituted (Ministry of Education, 1977). The\\nfundamental aim of these reforms was to produce an education that was properly attuned to\\nand met the aspirations of the Zambian people. With the stated reforms, Religious\\nEducation changed from its exclusive outlook in the denominational and ecumenical stages\\nto being educational. Further, the revision of both the junior and senior secondary\\nsyllabuses in conformity with the 1977 educational Reforms ultimately led to the\\ncontextualising of religious Education. Additionally, aspects of Zambian Humanism, which\\nwas the national philosophy at that time, Islam, Hinduism and Indigenous Traditional\\nbeliefs were incorporated and became part and parcel of Religious Education. This\\ninclusion saw the subject\\u2019s name change to Spiritual and Moral Education with its aim\\nstated as:\\nTo enable pupils to appreciate spiritual, moral, and religious values and\\nbehaviour based on them. This appreciation is drawn from the four main\\nreligious traditions in Zambia, namely Christianity, 185\\nZAMBIAN JOURNAL OF RELIGION AND CONTEMPORARY ISSUES\\nHinduism, Indigenous Zambian Beliefs, and Islam, and from the religious\\nelements of the Zambia philosophy of Humanism (MOE 1984: 4).\\nThe changes brought about by the 1977 Educational Reforms came into being when\\neducators sought to introduce a more multi-religious approach in the teaching of R.E. This\\nform of the subject was introduced to help learners live together in harmony and to have a\\nbetter understanding of what other people believe and do in order to promote an attitude of\\nopenness and tolerance, as well as a readiness to listen and ask questions instead of making\\njudgments based on inaccurate information (Kamanga, 2013).\\nIn the wake of the successful 1977 Education Reforms, there was a call for teachers\\nand lecturers to take up the initiative of producing new education materials locally (MoE,\\n1977). Thus, the Zambian Religious Education syllabus 2044 replaced the GABA \\u2018Christian\\nLiving Today\\u2019 and the Cambridge Bible Knowledge\\u2019 syllabuses although some evangelical\\nteachers on the Copperbelt Province expressed misgivings over the removal of the\\nCambridge Bible Knowledge Syllabus (Masterton, 1987). Arguing that Religious Education\\nSyllabus 2044 was philosophically Roman Catholic-biased, the evangelical teachers decided\\nto reform the old Cambridge Bible Knowledge syllabus to produce an alternative R.E.\\nsyllabus 2046, in 1984. Ever since, the two R.E. syllabuses have been running side by side.\\nSuffice to say, Mudalitsa (2006) contended that both RE syllabus 2044 and R.E. syllabus\\n2046 were of British origin. He argued that syllabus 2046 originated in the 1940s and was\\nintroduced in Zambia before independence under the name of Cambridge Bible Knowledge\\nsyllabus. On the other hand, syllabus 2044 originated in the early 1960s 186\\nJudith L. Ilubala-Ziwa, et al\\nand came to Zambia through East Africa as the \\u2018Christian Living Today\\u2019 syllabus\\n(Ibid).\\nIn 1991, Zambia reverted to multi-party system of governance and since then, the\\nperiod has been referred to as the third republic. During this era, the country witnessed an\\ninvigorated spirit of emphasis on various liberties both in the political as well as the\\neducational systems. On 29 December 1991, President Chiluba declared Zambia a Christian\\nnation. The reasons behind the declaration were, however, not clear leading to some people\\ncalling it, a unilateral declaration. To ardent supporters of the declaration, Chiluba made the\\nproclamation as a prophet rededication of the country to the will of God. Others though,\\ntook it that the declaration was more for political reasons than religious; the country was\\ntransitioning from the Kaunda era with its strong ideological background and to a greater\\nextent, the fear of the Islamic threat (Kamanga, 2013; Cheyeka, 2014).\\nUndoubtedly, the declaration was met with mixed feelings across the Zambian society\\nwith mostly evangelical Christians calling for the domination of Christianity as well as the\\nreintroduction of Bible Knowledge in schools while the Zambia Episcopal Conference as\\nwell as other citizens and those of different faiths had their reservations. On a religious\\nfront, the declaration of Zambia as a Christian nation did not reduce the influence of other\\nreligious traditions on Zambian culture because freedom of religion is constitutionally\\nguaranteed (Simuchimba, 2004). Politically, Cheyeka (2014) noted that the declaration of\\nZambia as a Christian nation gave force to the Pentecostal movement for their continued\\ninvolvement in the country\\u2019s affairs and a Religious Affairs desk was established at State\\nHouse. Educationally, the position of R.E. became contentious and the subject was said to\\nhave been affected 187\\nZAMBIAN JOURNAL OF RELIGION AND CONTEMPORARY ISSUES\\nby the declaration. The only non-religious source of RE content, Zambian Humanism,\\nwas removed from all the R.E. syllabuses (Kamanga, 2013) and there were calls for R.E. to\\nbe replaced by Bible Knowledge. The subject further saw a growing tendency of starting\\nlessons with a prayer by overzealous evangelical Religious Education teachers who felt\\nempowered by the declaration to turn the classroom into a church (Simuchimba, 2004).\\nIn order to address various aspects of freedoms, the country enacted the Zambian\\nConstitution of 1996 and formulated the 1996 National Educational Policy titled Educating\\nOur Future. Replacing the 1977 Educational Reforms, the 1996 document addressed the\\nentire field of formal institutional education, emphasizing democratisation, decentralisation\\nand productivity on the one hand, and curriculum relevance and diversification, efficient\\nand cost-effective management, capacity building, cost sharing and revitalized partnerships\\non the other hand (MoE, 1996). Additionally, the policy clearly indicates the mission of the\\nMinistry of Education as being able to guide the provision of education for all Zambians so\\nthat they are able to defend democratic ideals, and accept and value other persons on the\\nbasis of their personal worth and dignity, irrespective of gender, religion, ethnic origin, or\\nany other discriminatory characteristics.\\nTo ensure that the education system is in tandem with the tenants of pluralism, the\\npolicy document recognizes the ideals of democracy in its philosophical rationale as stated\\nbelow:\\nZambia is a democratic society. Hence, it is the values of liberal democracy that\\nmust guide its educational policies. The core values of liberal democracy are\\nrational and moral autonomy, equality, fairness and liberty (MoE, 1996).188\\nJudith L. Ilubala-Ziwa, et al\\nFrom this perspective, the declaration of Zambia as a Christian nation is at variance with\\nwhat the National Education Policy of 1996 espouses in that it does not resonate well with a\\nfast growing Zambian multi-religious society (Carmody, 2004).\\n3.0 Methodology\\nThis section discusses the research design, research study area, population, sample,\\nsampling techniques, instruments used for data collection, procedure for data collection and\\ndata analysis. The article used a qualitative approach, specifically, a case study design\\nwhich is an intensive study through which one can know precisely the factors and causes of\\na particular phenomenon (Ghosh, 1992). The design was chosen because the study\\u2019s task\\nwas to collect information on people\\u2019s opinions and other social and religious issues\\nconcerning the impact of the declaration of Zambia as a Christian Nation on Religious\\nEducation. The study was conducted in Lusaka District. The population comprised all R.E.\\nteachers, religious leaders from the three selected religions and pupils. The sample study\\ncomprised of 3 Religious Education teachers, 3 Religious leaders and 24 pupils, making a\\ntotal of 30 respondents. However, this study used purposive sampling and specifically\\ntypical sampling as it only targeted those respondents who were expected to have adequate\\nknowledge and information on the impact of the declaration of Zambia as a Christian\\nNation on Religious Education.\\nMoreover, data collection was done through the interviews with the aim to have the\\nparticipant reflect on his or her experiences and then relate those experiences to the\\ninterviewer in such a way that the two come to a mutual understanding about the meanings\\nof the experiences or 189\\nZAMBIAN JOURNAL OF RELIGION AND CONTEMPORARY ISSUES\\nof the account of the experiences. Besides, a focus group discussion was used to allow\\nemphasis on the questioning and construction of meaning (Bryman, 2001). The two\\nmethods allowed the researchers to interact with stakeholders and gather their views on the\\nimpact of the declaration of Zambia as a Christian Nation on Religious Education.\\n4.0 Findings\\nThe data was presented according to the themes derived from the objectives of the study.\\nChristian Nation and Religious Education\\nWhen asked to comment on the understanding of Religious Education, a pupil from school A\\nsaid that R.E. was a subject about God and other religions while the other pupils added that\\nReligious Education was a subject which showed how different religions viewed life. The reason\\nbehind taking the subject was that the subject was compulsory at the school and that it helped\\nthem appreciate different religions. Furthermore, another pupil stated, \\u201cReligious Education is\\nmore than a church service which enables pupils to understand different cultural perspectives,\\ndevelop life skills and help set personal principles as we interact with fellow pupils and other\\npeople from other religions.\\u201d\\nCommenting on what they knew about the declaration of Zambia as a Christian nation, the\\nmajority of the pupil participants indicated that the declaration was made by the late President\\nChiluba in 1991 and that it was a good thing as it set the Zambians apart and made the citizens to\\nrefrain from different vices.190\\nJudith L. Ilubala-Ziwa, et al\\nFrom School B, similar questions were asked and one pupil said, \\u201cReligious Education is\\ninteresting because it draws me closer to the Bible.\\u201d\\nAnother pupil indicated that RE was a good subject because it taught about morality\\nemphasized in different religions. She further added that she took R.E. because it was a\\ncompulsory subject at their school. Generally, the pupils noted that they learnt about other world\\nreligions not just Christianity. They added that the content of other world religions was enough\\nand useful in the sense that it helped them to understand other people\\u2019s religious experiences,\\ntheir beliefs and practices. Another pupil reasoned that:\\nTeaching and learning about one religion like Christianity in Zambia will\\ndiscriminate other people of different religious beliefs. It is through religious\\ndiscrimination that some countries do not have peace. So incorporating other\\nreligions in R.E. syllabuses was a good idea.\\nWith regard to knowledge about the declaration of Zambia as a Christian nation, one pupil\\nmentioned that it was President F.T.J. Chiluba who declared Zambia as a Christian nation\\nbecause he wanted to maintain peace in the country by having a people who would be molded\\nwith Christian values. This would help to come up with a society free from violence.\\nAt School C, pupils taking R.E. syllabus 2046 were asked to give their views about the\\nsubject. In response, one of the pupils indicated that R.E. was a subject that enabled them to\\nlearn about different religions and know more about the religions. She added that they took up\\nR.E. because they were asked to choose from the optional subjects offered by the school and that\\nthey picked Religious Education because they wanted to strengthen their faith and know what\\nother religious groups believed and how they worshipped. Moreover, the participants noted that\\nthey were taught other religions namely, 191\\nZAMBIAN JOURNAL OF RELIGION AND CONTEMPORARY ISSUES\\nIslam, Hinduism and Zambian traditional beliefs and practices.\\nOne pupil indicated the following:\\nThe content of what we learn in Religious Education is sufficient and helpful in the\\nsense that it helps us know what other people believe in and have tolerance in terms of\\nunderstanding religious issues; why other people behave in the way they behave or\\ncarry or rather conduct themselves in a particular way. Therefore, all religions should\\nbe taught in Religious Education in order for us to know and have a deep\\nunderstanding of the origin of each religion even when we do not belong to them.\\nFrom School C, when asked about the declaration of Zambia as a Christian nation, one pupil\\nindicated that the declaration was a plea for God\\u2019s spiritual covering. In addition, another pupil\\nindicated that the late former President Chiluba declared the nation Christian in order to avoid\\nthe anti-Christ that would completely distort the dominant Christian values that helped to\\nmaintain peace in the country since independence.\\nFurthermore, regarding R.E. syllabuses, a teacher from School A indicated that Religious\\nEducation syllabuses had been changing over time but she taught the syllabus offered at the\\nschool because of the school ethos. In terms of methods of delivery, the teacher mentioned\\nteacher exposition, role play and discussion methods as the most commonly used methods in\\nR.E. The teacher further indicated that the content about other religions in R.E. was sufficient as\\ndifferent religious concepts were covered. However, she suggested that more detailed\\ninformation should be added on other religions because the Christian part had more information\\nthan the other religions. In addition, she noted that all the major religions including the Chinese\\nreligions should be added because many people with different religious backgrounds were\\ncoming to Zambia and pupils needed to understand their religions.192\\nJudith L. Ilubala-Ziwa, et al\\nCommenting on the declaration of Zambia as a Christian Nation, the teacher said, \\u201cThe\\ndeclaration is a mere declaration without major effects on the teaching of Religious Education.\\nThe large Christian content is a result of historical factors and not the declaration itself.\\u201d\\nAt School B, a teacher teaching R.E. syllabus 2044, indicated that since he started teaching\\nthe subject, little had changed with regards to the content of R.E. at secondary school level. He\\nadded that though he was trained to teach both syllabuses, he taught syllabus 2044 because that\\nwas the syllabus taught at the school. According to the teacher at School B, he taught using\\ndifferent methods that he was taught at college though he found it challenging because of the\\ntime and material constraints. He added that the content in the syllabus about other religions was\\nenough and it included all the most dominant religious traditions in Zambia. The teacher further\\nnoted:\\nIt is fine to teach about the four main religions in Zambia. However, because of some\\nsocial and economic factors, many people of different religions such as Chinese and\\nJapanese have moved into Zambia with their children who sometimes take Religious\\nEducation as a subject at all levels of Education. Therefore, all identified religions\\nshould be taught in schools so that adherents of these religions could be familiar with\\nthe religions in Zambia and Zambians could also understand other people\\u2019s religious\\ntraditions. This can lead to tolerance among different religious groups.\\nWith regard to the declaration of Zambia as a Christian nation, the teacher from School B\\nindicated, \\u201cThe late former President Chiluba did a good thing to give Zambia such a big\\nreligious declaration for as long as he allowed freedom of worship and did not violate other\\npeople\\u2019s rights.\\u201d 193\\nZAMBIAN JOURNAL OF RELIGION AND CONTEMPORARY ISSUES\\nHe added that the declaration had secured the peace of the Zambian citizens despite some\\neconomic and political pressures the nation faced. He further indicated that in some African\\ncountries there was violence among religious groups due to lack of tolerance among the groups.\\nAt School C, the teacher captured in the study described R.E. as a very important subject\\nthat should be compulsory and taught in all schools because its content reminded humans about\\nthe \\u2018dos\\u2019 and \\u2018don\\u2019ts\\u2019 of society. Like other participants, the teacher indicated that he taught R.E.\\nsyllabus 2046 because it was the syllabus offered at the school. He mentioned that Religious\\nEducation syllabus 2046 was a common syllabus that was offered in most government schools.\\nHe further stated that he mostly used teacher exposition, question and answer, and group work\\nbecause of their effectiveness when it came to dealing with large numbers of pupils. He argued\\nthat the content on other religions wasinsufficient because the syllabus concentrated on\\nChristianity. He added that the syllabus had more content from the Bible than from the holy\\nscriptures of other religions that were included in syllabus. He therefore proposed that the\\nsyllabus should be reviewed in order to have a balance on content coverage. He also proposed\\nthat all the pronounced world religions should be included in the subject syllabuses as was the\\ncase at tertiary level. This would enable learners to understand people with different religious\\nvalues.\\nIn commenting on the declaration of Zambia as a Christian nation and R.E., the teacher\\nfrom School C said, \\u201cIt is something that came into being in the 1990s and has nothing to do\\nwith Religious Education syllabuses that were established in the early 1980s and are still in use\\nup to date despite minor changes in some topics.\\u201d194\\nJudith L. Ilubala-Ziwa, et al\\nImpact on Religious Education\\nWhen asked about the impact of the declaration of Zambia as a Christian nation on RE, the\\nmajority of the pupils noted that the declaration had not affected RE in any way because the\\npupils also learnt about other religions and that if it did, the RE content would have been all\\nChristian, as is the case in Muslim countries declared Muslim nations.\\nOne of the pupils said, \\u201cThe declaration does not make Christianity mandatory but it is only\\nthe values of the country that are based on Christianity.\\u201d\\nHowever, other pupils had the view that the declaration affected R.E. in that the content\\nside-lined other religions like Zambian Traditional practices, which were not captured fully in\\nthe syllabuses. They noted that non-Christians might feel out of place and they might not be free\\nto express their religious rights. In addition, one pupil observed that it was wrong for the late\\nPresident Chiluba to declare Zambia a Christian nation since there were many religions in\\nZambia.\\nHe concluded, \\u201chowever, the declaration has no impact on how R.E. is taught since R.E.\\nteachers do not make reference to it when teaching.\\u201d\\nFurthermore, the findings from the teacher at School A confirmed that the declaration did\\nnot have any effect on the teaching of R.E. He added that the large Christian content was as a\\nresult of historical factors and not the declaration. In the same line, the teacher from School B\\nwas of the view that the declaration had not affected the teaching and learning of Religious\\nEducation because it firstly gave room to religious freedom and that the R.E. syllabuses\\nattempted to cater even for other religions which had very few followers in Zambia. In addition,\\nthe teacher from School C observed that the R.E. syllabuses had nothing to do with the\\ndeclaration which was too recent. He suggested that the way forward would be for teachers to\\nteach like professionals and not like pastors who inclined themselves to one faith.195\\nZAMBIAN JOURNAL OF RELIGION AND CONTEMPORARY ISSUES\\nReligious leaders from three different religious traditions were also interviewed to find out\\ntheir views on the declaration to the R.E. Religious leader A indicated that he had little\\nbackground of what was offered in R.E. pointing out that he only took the subject at Primary\\nschool but appreciated its content. He indicated that R.E. was basic but balanced and portrayed a\\npositive attitude to faith. It was an educational subject which did not aim at swaying learners\\ntowards a particular religion. Accordingly, R.E. was an ideal subject because it covered all the\\nmajor religions and it had well-balanced information that encouraged learners and those they\\ninteracted with to understand each other for the betterment of the Zambian society.\\nCommenting on the declaration of Zambia as a Christian nation, Religious leader A\\nindicated that he appreciated the declaration because, generally, the Zambian citizens did not\\nseem to be concerned about the declaration. It had not caused any overzealous attitudes among\\nthe people of Zambia. He further indicated that the declaration did not affect the teaching of R.E.\\nbecause R.E. still accommodated other religions and Christianity as a religion promoted\\ncoexistence among different groups of people.\\nData was also collected from Religious leader B so as to gather her views on the impact of\\nthe declaration on R.E. She was firstly asked whether she did R.E. during her school career to\\nwhich she responded that she did the subject only at junior secondary school level. Her general\\nview on R.E. in Zambia was that the content focused much on Christianity and Islam with little\\ninformation on other world religions. Religious leader B further indicated that the imbalance in\\ncontent for major world religions made the syllabuses not to be ideal because there was clear\\nindication that the syllabuses enhanced religious discrimination. She suggested that all the major\\nnine religions of the world should be included in order for pupils to have insight of other\\nreligions. 196\\nJudith L. Ilubala-Ziwa, et al\\nReligious leader B then concluded that the content for other religions was not sufficient and\\nhelpful. Therefore:\\nThough Zambia is a Christian nation, the Zambian Religious Education syllabuses\\nshould promote coexistenceamong all Zambians by including and having a balance of\\nall religions. Furthermore, the principle of love which puts emphasis on embracing all\\nkinds of people even those from other religions should be reflected in the syllabuses.\\nWith regard to the declaration, I find it to be a good idea because it protects the country\\nfrom political vices. The declaration has not affected on Religious Education because\\nthe syllabuses were there even before the declaration was pronounced. The way\\nforward is to further revisit the R.E. syllabuses to meet the needs of all Zambians.\\nThere is need to engage scholars and curriculum developers in research to explore all\\nother world religions and include the content in the R.E. syllabuses.\\nReligious leader C was also interviewed to get his views on how the declaration had affected\\nR.E. in Zambia. He started by noting that he had not done R.E. at secondary school level but had\\nsome basics of the subject from primary school. He added that as the director of one of the\\nChurch mother bodies, he had knowledge about the type of R.E. that was offered in Zambia\\nbecause his organisation stocked all the primary and secondary school R.E. syllabuses.\\nAccording to Religious leader C, the R.E. content was too broad to be understood by the\\nlearners. This was because of the inclusion of other religions which distorted the Christian faith\\nbuilt in children before they started school. He added that R.E. should focus on Christianity\\nbecause children should come face to face with the original faith they received from their parents\\nor guardians. He noted that:\\nThe inclusion of other religions in RE syllabuses is like a person who works in the\\nbank and has not been trained to distinguish between the fake and true currency. By the\\ntime the banker 197\\nZAMBIAN JOURNAL OF RELIGION AND CONTEMPORARY ISSUES\\nrealises that he is receiving fake currency, he will have lost out a lot of money.\\nTherefore, if other religions are introduced to pupils at primary and secondary level,\\nthen it is as good as a banker who loses out because of fake notes. Let other religions\\nbe introduced at tertiary level because by then, the learners will have been matured\\nenough to decide or choose where they should belong.\\nIn response to the question whether the content on other religions was sufficient, Religious\\nleader C was of the view that it was more than sufficient and that it was actually not supposed to\\nbe included because Zambia was a Christian Nation and embracing other religions was like\\nhaving an open cheque which could be signed by anybody. However, the Religious leader\\nacknowledged that tolerance of other religions was a good thing. He added that the Christian\\nnation Declaration was not there to restrict anyone from converting to other religions the\\ndeclaration should set limits in order not to have the same credit hours as the dominant Christian\\nfaith. However, the religious leader noted that:\\nThe declaration has positively affected Religious Education in Zambia in the sense that\\nit has made people realise the fact that it is not just any one who can teach the subject\\nlike the way other subjects are taught even by drunkards or immoral people. Putting\\nthe declaration in mind, RE teachers should realise that they are role models expected\\nto have high moral standards. Failure to do so defeats the whole purpose of teaching\\nthe subject.\\nHe therefore suggested that the title Religious Education was not appropriate. \\u201cI wish it was\\ncalled Bible Knowledge or Bible Education, since it is Christian dominated. The syllabuses\\nshould further be revised with more consultations from the Christian Clergy.\\u201d198\\nJudith L. Ilubala-Ziwa, et al\\n5.0 Discussion\\nThe main purpose of the paper was to establish whether the declaration of Zambia as a\\nChristian nation had any impact on Religious Education. The discussion is presented under\\nthemes drawn from the findings which are: Christian nation and Religious Education and\\nImpact on Religious Education. Finally, the discussion ends with a conclusion.\\nChristian nation and Religious Education\\nThe first objective was to establish the views of stakeholders on the declaration of Zambia as a\\nChristian nation and R.E. The findings showed that stakeholders had an understanding of the\\ndeclaration of Zambia as a Christian nation and Religious Education.\\nReligious Education as a curriculum subject had been changing over time and the syllabus\\noffered in a school was mostly informed by the school ethos. Thus, while Catholic schools\\noffered syllabus 2044, Protestant schools and most government schools offered syllabus 2046.\\nSo R.E. teachers taught either syllabus 2044 or 2046 because that was the syllabus adopted by\\nthe school, though they were trained to teach both syllabuses.\\nIn terms of methods of delivery, the findings showed that teacher exposition, role play and\\ndiscussion methods were the most commonly used methods in the teaching of Religious\\nEducation. Though teacher exposition is a teacher centered method, the R.E. teachers involved in\\nthe study used the method because the content compelled them to. It is not possible for R.E.\\nteachers to teach about the doctrines, beliefs and practices without using teacher exposition\\nmethod sometimes. We need to note here that, teaching methods play a crucial role in the process\\nof imparting knowledge in the learners (Kamanga, 2013).199\\nZAMBIAN JOURNAL OF RELIGION AND CONTEMPORARY ISSUES\\nFrom the information gathered, it was clear that all the stakeholders had some\\nunderstanding of the declaration of Zambia as a Christian nation and to a great extent; they held\\nthat the declaration was good for the country. The late former President Chiluba did a good thing\\nto give Zambia such a religious declaration. The declaration did not get in the way of the\\nZambian citizens since the people were free to belong to any religion of their choice.\\nFurthermore, the declaration secured the peace of the country despite the economic and political\\npressures other nations experienced due to politically motivated groups that exercised extreme\\nreligious freedom.\\nThe article further shows that R.E. was a curriculum subject which promoted tolerance and\\ncoexistence. It did not aim at converting learners towards a particular religion, but to enhance\\nunderstanding of the different religions practiced in Zambia. However, the response by one\\nreligious leader who submitted that R.E. should focus on Christianity because children should\\ncome face to face with the original faith, whether Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Zambian\\ntradition faith or any other religion from parents, confirms Simuchimba\\u2019s (2005) conclusion that\\nthe educationally, unacceptable, denominational practice of Religious Education being a vehicle\\nof evangelism unfortunately continued to exist in Zambia. It is further challenged by Henze\\n(2003) who pointed out:\\nReligious Education in school is inclusive and pluralistic, and it aims to be experiential\\nand participatory, which is different from the denominational teaching found in church\\nnurture groups. In this way, Religious Education challenges the church especially in\\nthe way they deal with traditional beliefs, other denominations and religions, as well as\\ntheir teaching methods.\\nEven though this submission might be looked at as the odd one out, it ought to be considered\\nwith the seriousness it deserves, because it goes against the educational principles on which\\nmodern R.E. is premised and reflects the long standing view 200\\nJudith L. Ilubala-Ziwa, et al\\nheld by some R.E. teachers who feel that they are duty bound to preach the gospel to their pupils\\n(Kamanga, 2013).\\nThough there was an indication among some pupils that they took R.E. because of its value\\nof promoting interpersonal skills as well as the appreciation of different religious traditions, most\\ndid the subject because it was compulsory in their schools. However, it should be noted that the\\ncompulsory status of R.E. in some mission schools could not be attributed to the declaration of\\nZambia as a Christian nation but to other historical factors as shown in the study.\\nFurthermore, the findings showed that R.E. was taken as a subject by pupils because they\\nwere asked to choose from the optional subjects offered by the school and that they picked R.E.\\nbecause they wanted to strengthen their faith and know what other religions believed in and how\\nthey worshipped.\\n6.0 Implications on Religious Education as a Curriculum Subject\\nWith the ongoing debates, on the political front, on whether the declaration of Zambia as a\\nChristian nation should be maintained in the constitution, one would expect that the\\ndeclaration had an impact on Religious Education. From the onset, it can be asserted that\\neven with the passage of time, the declaration of Zambia as a Christian nation remains\\ncontroversial. Due to various dynamics and how things have unfolded in the country, some\\npeople hold relatively the same views about the declaration while others have undoubtedly\\nchanged their stance. While overzealousness and outright unprofessionalism on the part of\\nsome R.E. teachers were observed as part of the immediate impacts of the declaration, the\\nfindings of the study showed that the declaration did not have any serious implications on\\nR.E. and this was affirmed by Simuchimba (2004) when he contended that the declaration\\ndid not have much force in the Zambian society.201\\nZAMBIAN JOURNAL OF RELIGION AND CONTEMPORARY ISSUES\\nFrom the responses by the teachers on the declaration of Zambia as a Christian nation,\\nthe article established that the declaration was a mere declaration and that the large\\nChristian content in both syllabus 2044 and 2046 was as a result of historical factors not the\\ndeclaration. A look at the history of R.E. in Zambia pointed to the fact that much of what is\\ntaught is derived from the colonial government. As contended by Chita (2011), the\\nmissionary dominance in the educational system was without doubt the reason there always\\nhad been a place for R.E. in the school curriculum.\\nEven with the various revisions of the syllabuses, it is worth noting that R.E. has\\nretained the same name, aim and with the exception of Zambian Humanism, relatively the\\nsame content that resulted from the 1977 Educational Reforms (Mudalitsa, 2016). In other\\nwords, in as much as it attempts to incorporate other religious traditions, the subject is\\nChristian biased (Kamanga, 2013). With very little changes, R.E. syllabuses in use today\\nwere developed in the mid-1980s. As such, the Christian inclination could not be attributed\\nto the declaration which was made in 1991.\\nIn relation to the above, the learners included in the study pointed out that the\\ndeclaration of Zambia as a Christian nation had not affected R.E. in any way because they\\nalso learnt about other religions. If the declaration had an effect on R.E., the subject content\\nwould have been all Christian. Furthermore, the findings gathered from the teachers showed\\nthat the declaration had not affected the teaching and learning of R.E. because it gave room\\nto religious freedom in the sense that learners can share their beliefs in class. Additionally,\\nR.E. syllabuses attempt to cater for other religions which have very few followers in\\nZambia. This view was at variance with the observations made by Simuchimba (2004).202\\nJudith L. Ilubala-Ziwa, et al\\nAdditionally, the findings gathered from the religious leaders showed that the Islamic\\nand Baha\\u2019i communities appreciated the declaration of Zambia as a Christian nation as it\\nwas a good thing. The declaration enhanced tolerance among Zambians who belonged to\\ndifferent religions. It has not caused overzealous attitudes among the Zambian citizens. This\\nrepresents a shift in opinion from the initial fears that were experienced by religious groups,\\nother than Christians, in the years following the declaration. They genuinely feared that they\\nmight be victimised and subjected to misfits in a Christian nation. As things stand on the\\nground, every faith community can carry out its activities without any impediments and\\nhave probably come to accept, as Cheyeka (2014) puts it, that the implementation of the\\ndeclaration of Zambia as a Christian nation was illusionary. The findings gathered from the\\nreligious leaders further showed that the declaration had not affected R.E. because the\\nsubject still accommodated other religions and that Christianity as a religion, promoted\\npeaceful coexistence among different religious groups. Here too, one would argue that the\\nfears, ignited by calls from mostly the Evangelical clergy, to have an exclusivist form of\\nR.E. had been watered down as shown by the continued presence of other religious\\ntraditions in the syllabuses.\\nOn the other hand, the findings gathered from an Evangelical Fellowship of Zambia\\nreligious leader showed that the declaration had positively affected R.E. in Zambia in the\\nsense that it had made Zambians realise that it was not just any one who could teach the\\nsubject like the way other subjects were taught even by drunkards or immoral people. With\\nthe declaration, R.E. teachers should realise that they are role models expected to have\\nhigher moral standards or the subject would defeat the whole purpose of 203\\nZAMBIAN JOURNAL OF RELIGION AND CONTEMPORARY ISSUES\\nteaching the Christian faith. Clearly, the respondent here was reiterating the\\nobservations made by Simuchimba (2004) that certain sectors of society were calling for the\\nclergy to take over the teaching of R.E. Presently, though, as the results suggested, R.E. is\\ntaught by professionally trained teachers regardless of their religious affiliation. The subject\\nwas also taught according to educational dictums and the unprofessional conduct of\\nproselytising in the classroom and staring lessons with a Christian prayer was not\\nevidenced. This could be attributed to the works of R.E. scholars who had since the\\ndeclaration, called on R.E. teachers to be professionally neutral. It is also attributed to the\\ntraining the teachers receive form universities and colleges of education, which requires all\\nteachers to handle the subject openly without being biased to one religion.\\nFurthermore, the findings from the Evangelical clergyman showed that the Christian\\nnation declaration was not there to compel any adherents of other religions to belong to\\nChristianity but it had set limits in order not to have content equal to Christianity in the R.E.\\nsyllabuses. No such limits and safe guards should be included in either educational\\nmaterials or policy documents. A look at the 2013 Curriculum Framework shows that R.E.\\nis at crossroads. The 2013 Curriculum Framework has shaken the foundations of R.E. by\\nmaking all subjects promote the values R.E. was originally meant to promote. Furthermore,\\nin the 2013 Curriculum Framework, at junior secondary school level, R.E. is compulsory\\nbut the subject is not included in the Vocational pathway. At senior secondary level, the\\nsubject is optional in both pathways. In 2016, the Ministry of General Education (MoGE)\\nannounced that at junior secondary school learners in the Vocational pathway would also\\ntake R.E. to meet the required number 204\\nJudith L. Ilubala-Ziwa, et al\\nof subjects for certification. At this point, while it can be argued that R.E. has been\\ngiven a lifeline, it is clear that the decision was purely academic or educational. The\\ndecision was not related to the declaration of Zambia as a Christian nation.\\n7.0 Conclusion and Recommendations\\nThe article aimed at ascertaining the impact of the declaration of Zambia as a Christian\\nnation on Religious Education. In line with the objectives of the article, it should be\\nconcluded that stakeholders have a fairly good understanding of the declaration and R.E. as\\na school curriculum subject. In terms of the declaration, stakeholders acknowledged that it\\nwas a good move because it, in a way, worked as a safeguard against different vices\\nexperienced by the learners and the teachers. With regard to the impact that the declaration\\nhad on RE, the study established that the declaration had no impact on the subject in that the\\nperceived Christian bias in the R.E. syllabuses was a result of deep rooted historical factors,\\nnot the declaration. Furthermore, the religious activities which were conducted in R.E.\\nlessons, such as prayer before teaching, were as a result of school ethos. In mission schools\\nprayer had been going on from time immemorial.\\nThe article aimed at ascertaining the impact ofthe declaration of Zambia as a\\nChristian nation The on Religious Education.
